This video made me upset. I love traveling and I love flying. I guess you could say it is my guilty pleasure, since I do care about the environment. This lecture upset me because I learned about how flying for about 24 hours leads to about 3 tons of CO2 to be emitted into the atmosphere and according to the paris climate accords would account for about a year and halfs of one’s personal GHG emissions. This means that even if I am extremely environmentally conscious it would be a waste since my flying time would discredit it. I’m also having a hard time understanding how air travel contributes so much to climate change. Is jet fuel that much worse than gasoline for a car? Ken did not address this. Also where is this “3 tons of CO2” contribution coming from? Is this only from fuel used or are there other factors? Does that mean that entire flight produces 450 tons of CO2, assuming that there 150 people on the flight and you travel for 24 hours? I’d like to hear more about this.

<br><br>
Also this slow trip movement sounds nice in thought but it really isn’t practical. People have jobs, families, school and other obligations that don't allow for someone to add on a week to vacation due to travel. Yes, I would love to travel across the country by train but that would take about a week and I can’t do that everytime I travel. The whole point of air travel is to get somewhere quick. There must be some other solution to air travel. A couple of times I’ve seen new stories about electric planes. Ken really doesn’t like trying to solve problems with technology but what if we changed air travel so that planes didn’t pollute as much?

I completely agree with you. It's crazy to me that even if we take many other steps toward improving our carbon footprint, flying can ruin it entirely. I too, however, would like to learn where these numbers are coming from and want to see if newer technology can improve the emissions.

<br><br>

Your second paragraph is spot on. While slow travel may be cheaper, it takes longer meaning that you are away from your daily life for longer. It seems like a great idea but like you said, people have jobs and school and other obligations and this longer style of travel seems unrealistic to do frequently. Many people travel by plane for work and that is something that is not going to change. Planes were made to get people to their destination faster so that is why so many choose it as their main means of transportation.

<br><br>

My worry with this and every other subject we have talked about in this class, is that it is too late to change. Our society becomes so accustomed to our way of life, having to make all of these changes in a short amount of time seems very unlikely.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. Even if I have done all the ways I can do to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas and pollution, the carbon dioxide emitted to the environment during the flying will ruin my efforts for the entire year. I used to think of how much Carbon dioxide the flight will emit to the environment, but I never realize that it is such a large amount until now. The concept of slow trip mentioned by Ken is kind of convincing, but I do need the time saved from plane to take a break at home. Some of us may enjoy the slow trip, but how many of us have time to do so? The production of plane has already emitted tons of pollution to the environment. If we do not take a flight, the cost of the plane will become the sunk cost and a total waste of money, resource, and time. Would it lower the average cost of a flight if we take more flights to our destination?
<br><hr>
I'd agree that this lecture left me with a lot of questions, and I am very interested in hearing more about this topic. I think that a lot of people who deny climate change or question its existence have good questions and complaints that are completely understandable for reasons similar to the ones that you described. The abstractness of the numbers and the vagueness of some of the statistics leave some room for questions. While I by no means doubt the disastrous effects that air travel has, I'm curious what all these statistics really mean for an individual who is very environmentally-minded but still occasionally flies. 

<br><br>

I also think that the slow trip movement sounds nice in theory, but is quite unrealistic in many circumstances. People have responsibilities and can't afford the extra time that slow travel costs. Though I find it unrealistic for travel over long distances, I find it very reasonable to minimize air travel and utilize other forms of transportation like trains and buses whenever possible for modest to short distances. While taking a train across the country is a bit excessive, utilizing this more efficient form of transportation at the cost of just a few hours is very doable.

<br><hr>
I relate to this post in that I don't know what to do now knowing that I can't travel efficiently and sustainably at the same time. “In little under 24 hours, you would have caused three tons of carbon dioxide to be directly emitted into the upper atmosphere” from an 8 hour flight. This fact sucks. So much. My family lives in Brazil and to visit them, there’s no way that I am going to hike there, or bike there, and I am almost certain there are no trains there, and I am pretty sure that it’s probably bad for the environment and marine life to take a cruise to Rio. As much as I would want to not fly, there is nothing I can really do or else I don’t see them. We don’t go every year, it’s become every 2 years or so as I have gotten older, but it just sucks thinking about how much I am ruining the environment every time I fly. The statistic of 3 tons is just so large I can’t really even get my mind around it. I relate so much to Hitlner’s example of a person who tries to live sustainably: I’m vegan, ride my bike everywhere, whatever, don’t use straws, I try, but knowing that none of it really matters because of planes is just shitty.

<br><hr>
I agree that flying would also be a guilty pleasure for me. Yeah, it sucks how flying from LA to Paris already takes up a year and a half's of one's personal GHG emissions according to the Paris climate agreement. I know that it seems that you flying would discredit your environmentally conscious actions but doing somethings is better than nothing. Yeah, I think since the plane is significantly heavier than a car, it uses a lot more fuel than a car and requires more energy. Yeah, I was pretty confused on why does flying first class double your CO2 emission since aren't they in the same plane as the people who fly business class.
<br><br>

I agree that slow trip movement isn't practical but I think that was a part of Ken's point. How we have to be more willing to sacrifice and how it is about the journey rather than the destination. I think if someone does not take frequent vacations, taking a week off is very possible but it is not as convenient. I think electric planes could lead to a whole other whirlwind of issues since it also has the potential to omit a lot of CO2.
<br><br>

I am definitely on the same boat as you. I'm planning to fly with my friends to Seattle over spring break but after hearing how much pollution I am causing, I feel guilty going. I wish that we could just take the train but it costs more and takes up too much time out of our already short break. I hope Ken can give faster travel solutions to actually make giving up flying a real possibility. I did not know this issue only applies to 1% of the world.

<br><hr>

 I shared your frustration. I'll admit it, I love to travel, I've taken many planes rides around the country. And while yes I know how awful it is for the countries, the alternative slow travel movement is insanely impractical for most journeys. My trip to new york would take days to get there from LA, I could never find time in my schedule to travel for that long. The trip there and back would be more time than my total trip if I was flying. There has to be another solution, just not found yet. The most practical thing in this video would be to fly less. Instead of a trip a year or multiple trips of the year, save up and take a luxury trip every few years.  I love traveling, it has helped develop my character and it is something my kids will know. So I can take action to fly less but slow travel movement is impractical for long-distance trips and not flying is absurd.
<br><hr>
I connected to this comment for so many reasons. I don't get to travel that much but love flying when the rare occasion presents itself and I have always wanted to fly first class. But finding out that flying first class is twice the amount of CO2 emission is so frustrating and impossible to justify. I also don't understand why planes contribute so much CO2, is it just a large amount of fuel needed? I too would like Ken to address your questions because I am genuinely curious. I can't believe a roundtrip flight to Paris is more than the allotted personal CO2 emission for over a year. 
<br><br>

I love the suggestions of alternative ways to travel other than just pointing out only how awful air travel is. I have always wanted to take a train and this video really encouraged that. Comparing slow travel to slow cooking and slow fashion really hit home because it really puts into perspective what we are sacrificing to save time. Our inability to take time alone or to pause from constant hustle and bustle is so odd. The suggestion of taking one large trip rather than a bunch of small ones was such a good suggestion. It really focuses on what is realistic for all these people who want to see the world and finds a realistic approach.

<br><hr>
In regard to your claims on the slow trip movement, I agree with him. Coming from Northern California, it is inconvenient for me to take a train for only a weekend. The train ride from Santa Barbara to Sacramento is over twelve hours long, meaning an entire day is gone from sitting on a train. Yes, it would be a great way to see parts of California I don’t spend time in, but it isn’t time efficient if I’m travelling home for only a weekend. I were to leave on a Friday at noon, even though I can’t even leave that early without skipping 2 classes, I wouldn’t get home until after midnight, have all day Saturday and have to hop back on a train Sunday morning.
 <br><br>

However, if I take a plane to Sacramento, it is a little over an hour, much like Ken explained in his example with San Francisco. It seems way more practical for me to fly home on a Friday midday than train; that way I would still be able to spend time with family before Friday ended. Similarly, instead of leaving Sunday morning, I would be able to leave Sunday night, giving me an entire extra day at home.
 <br><br>

I understand for longer breaks like Winter break it would be reasonable to spend one day travelling home and one day back to Santa Barbara, as I would only lose two days of three weeks. However, going home for three days would mean 2 days on a train. In that case, selfishly, I would much rather take an airplane.

<br><hr>
This lecture video also left me curious about Ken’s calculations of emitting 3 tons of CO2 by flying from Santa Barbara to Paris. As a student who lives across the country from UCSB, I fly back home for summer and winter breaks. While slow travel would be a reasonable option for the summers, it would take a considerable amount of time out of our already brief winter break. However, I don’t think the point of this lecture video is to convince us to completely eliminate all air travel immediately; rather, I think Ken wants us to consider a more gradual transition, starting by just reducing the amount of times we fly. Like the example from the video, some trips could be split up by taking a plane for half of the journey and taking the bus/train for the other part. Although this isn’t a complete solution, it at least decreases our carbon footprint in some way. I think this approach makes the idea of solving the climate crisis less intimidating in multiple areas of the issue. For example, rather than immediately going from an omnivorous diet to a vegan one, people can start by first cutting out beef, then all meats, until they have transitioned to a plant-based lifestyle. Adopting gradual transitions into more sustainable lives would make the issue seem more doable, especially regarding travel.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. While I definitely believe that we all must do our best to reduce our emissions and carbon footprint, sometimes it just isn’t practical to take a train across the country. Most of my family lives in the Midwest and we often try to drive there from California instead of fly, taking days off from work and school. While we are fortunate to be able to do this, most cannot. I would love to hear more practical alternatives, specifically with new technology. I was also a little confused to hear that flying creates a bigger footprint than trains or cars, I would really like to have this clarified. 
  <br><br>

Regardless, I thought the video was extremely insightful and made me much more aware of my environmental footprint. I love flying and I had no idea I was in the 1% because of this. It was interesting to hear that 19/20 people have never been on an airplane and that the wealthy are responsible for air plane emissions. It was a wake up call and reminded me that just being conscious of my food and clothing purchases is not enough. To hear that flying can double or triple our personal carbon footprint was frustrating. While learning about climate change usually motivates me, hearing this was hard.

<br><hr>
Although air travel is disastrous for the planet in the way it currently works, it doesn’t have to be ruled out completely; we just need to be more mindful of when we chose to utilize it. We live in a society that’s fast paced and focused on convenience, so “slow travel” and train rides across the country don’t sound like easy, practical options. However, I believe a big part of that can largely be attributed to the way our society is set up and how it functions. A mass cultural revolution to combat the climate crisis would be needed; if the way the work week is set up is changed, and our views on efficiency and convenience are transformed, then maybe slow travel would be much more plausible. On the alternative, I believe it's very likely that more sustainable, yet efficient technology will still arise, like Maglev trains or electric airplanes, yet the production and implementation of these ideas will still contribute to the climate crisis, so it will likely have to be further down the road.
  <br><br>
Despite this, the fact of the matter is that air travel will not sustain our planet if it keeps functioning the way it does. Until solutions are found that can revolutionize the way it works to cut emissions, the best thing we can do is simply be much more mindful and reduce the amount of times we use it, and if possible, avoid it altogether.
<br><hr>
As the others who've replied, I share a lot of your concerns. I do think it's important to consider Ken's vision of a cultural change. Our culture does place a high value on air travel, and transportation is a key factor in our global economy. While our current consumption habits may involve frequent flying, I think the purpose of this lecture/this class is to consider the possibility of changing those habits.
  <br><br>

For example, you and I are part of the 5% of people in the world who've even set foot on a plane. So for 95% of people in the world, air travel isn't even on their priority list. That's a culture difference that clearly shows how air travel doesn't need to be a part of our lives. 
  <br><br>

And don't get me wrong, I completely see the other side. My brother is a consultant who travels for work, usually to cities across the country. Taking slow travel does not make sense in his fast-paced work environment, and, often, his responsibilities warrant his physical presence rather than through telecommunication. Like you said, people have jobs, families, and other obligations that don't allow for the methods of travel that Ken specified.
  <br><br>

I'm glad you mentioned electric planes, too. After a quick search I've found that they're only suitable for 1,000 mile distances as of now. But, as with solar panels and other technology, all it needs is to be invested in quickly to promote research and development of that technology. Soon, science could produce zero-emissions planes that could revolutionize how we travel.  For a cultural solution, I would propose a change in celebrity culture. Celebrities emit so much more greenhouse gasses because of their travel habits, so if society began to value celebrities less, that would lead to a decrease in carbon emissions from those people. Coldplay, for example, postponed their world tour until they could make their travel environmentally sustainable.
<br><hr>
I love all of the questions you ask and would also like to hear Ken elaborate on the stuff he addressed. You have brought up stuff that I did not even think about or question. I also found it crazy how a round trip from LA to Paris, meaning that you are in the air for less than 24 hours, gives off 3 TONS of Co2. AND, in addition to Co2, mononitrogen oxide increase short term climate impact by two-three times more. I feel so gully as well because my family takes vacation trips every summer and knowing that each individual on the planet emmite their average 2 metric tons of Co2 a year in In a single 24 hour time period is INSANE. AND if you fly first class you spent you 2 year emission. 
  <br><br>

Ken also references how wealthy individuals own private jets which inflicts as much harm to the planet but we see it as “glamorous” to own such a thing. This idea goes back to the ‘American Dream’ aspect of owning as much luxurious stuff as possible in order to be deemed as successful. The people who travel by air is a practice to the wealthiest more privilege/successful people on the planet. These individuals are called ‘jet sets’ but I have recently learned that this term is now widespread to rare fliers, casual fliers and jet owners. 
  <br><br>

Since air travel could be doubling or tripling your personal climate footprint, Ken tells us about the slow travel movement which advises us to do half the trip by train and the other half by plane which decreases the mileage. This means we have to plan ahead of time and make more time for us to travel by train or electric bikes to the closest airport. But like Jamieson said, this is unreasonable because people have jobs, families, school and other obligations that don't allow for someone to add on a week to vacation due to travel inflictions. A more reasonable semi solution that Ken stated and I agree with is Instead of two short vacations, families should have one grand trip every 5 years. Also, a quote that Ken said that I really loved is “Life is about the journey not the destination.” I think more people need to realize this.

<br><hr>

I too was frustrated by this video. I myself enjoy traveling, although I have only flown a handful of times. When Ken began addressing how terrible flying is for our planet, I was rather surprised, but not yet upset. I can see how flying can release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, and according to the Paris Accord, can account for around the same amount of one's GHG emissions for a year and half. I can also agree with Ken that this statistic is worrisome. Also, as the video progressed, hearing that a single flight could erase all of the work I have put into reducing my carbon footprint was disheartening. I had no idea the severity of the damage flying could cause and it bothers me that I have been unaware for so long, as I like to think that I would have been more conscious of the way that I travel if I would have known. But, after reading your comment, I am starting to get more upset by this video. 

  <br><br>

One of my best friends, one that I plan to have in my life until the day that I die, moved to Tennessee during the spring of our junior year of high school. This move was extremely hard for the both of us and made holding onto to our friendship very hard. As Ken addressed in this video, we were able to utilize "telepresence" technologies such as Facetime and phone calls to stay in touch, but as most people in long distance relationships know, it is not the same as being face to face and together, in person. Therefore, be both agreed that this wasn't enough and worked together to get me out to Tennessee for a visit. I did in fact take a trip to see him during the summer before my senior year. And yes, I flew. This video, at first, made me feel bad for using my entire amount of GHG emissions for that year on this trip. But now, I am just pissed. I'm sorry if this upsets anyone that is extremely conscious of their carbon footprint, or would never fly again after watching this video, but I do not regret taking that trip. I would put my friendships before my carbon footprint in a heartbeat, as I was not about to take the train all the way across the country, or ride an "ebike" for a short three day trip. As you said in your comment, "the whole point of air travel is to get somewhere quick." In this case, I had a single three day weekend to see my friend and had to be back in time for my first day of senior year. Air travel was the most efficient option based on the situation, in my opinion. It is frustrating to hear that my choice was a bad one and I agree that there must be some other solution to air travel.

<br><hr>
I also do not understand how the math works out. A typical plane weighs ~45tons and the fuel weighs ~20tons. If that’s 20 tons of pure carbon, it would produce like 73 tons of carbon dioxide. There are about 100 people on a plane. So one person got less than one ton carbon dioxide emission for a flight. I was thinking if the plane fuel is highly compressed that would make the result different. However, no matter how compressed the fuel is, you cannot change the mass of a carbon atom. Therefore, I think the 3 tons of CO2 emission for one person is an exaggeration. But still, we emit about half year of our personal GHG emission if my kindergarten math is correct. 

  <br><br>

I agree with you that there are no other means of travel faster than a plane. However, my view of a vacation is that we need to enjoy our free time. It is not always about to go to a must-see destination, instagram post it, then move to the next spot. I think a journey shouldn’t have any targets. We can enjoy everything that comes across on a trip, instead of being enslaved by the destinations. I do not even know what I am talking about myself but I think you can get it.
<br><hr>

I agree with this comment completely, I have traveled a few times by plane and I have a trip coming up soon too. I was not aware that flying was so detrimental to the climate crisis and that it increased my carbon footprint so drastically. I definitely would use an alternative form of transport but the ones listed were so impractical. For the trip I have coming up, it is a destination wedding and in the middle of school, I could take one to two days off but I would not have the time to just slow travel for a week. If I could take the time off slow traveling sounds nice but it is just not possible with my schedule. If I can't even afford this time off then I don't know that others do, it seems like a great idea and is much cheaper but unless there is another alternative I do not think this will happen.
<br><hr>
you hit it on the money. The amount of people who answer with “after college, I am going to spend some time traveling,” when asked what comes next is extremely significant. Me included. When Jamison brought up the difference between jet pack fuel versus the gasoline for cars I had also questioned that during the lecture. Unfortunately, some of the greatest wonders of the world are across the pond and hurting the environment is inevitable. I can’t drive to ride a camel in Egypt. I can’t drive to the Eiffel tower in Paris. I can’t drive to go on a safari in Africa. This did make me think however about the changes I can make for traveling in the United States. 
  <br><br>

For starters, I am from Sacramento. I could easily drive to Santa Barbara but out of sheer laziness I always choose to fly. This has a great environmental impact that I was unaware of before Professor Hiltner’s lecture. This does go back to the difference between car and jet fuel. Would the change be that significant for the environment or no?
  <br><br>

Another fact discussed in the lecture was that 19/20 people have never stepped foot on a plane. This was shocking. I was always under the naïve impression that everyone was flying. It wasn’t until I had a conversation with another student in the class, that I realized it is really just the United States that relies on flying for travel. Many countries across the world, citizens aren’t wealthy enough to fly. It is not a thing. In addition, in Europe, the most common mode of transportation is taking the train. My question to professor Hiltner would be, how does that affect the environment? 
  <br><br>

Also, the United States is just the worst


<br><hr>
I have the same feeling as you. I also love traveling and flying always pops out first on my mind when I am planning a future trip. Before watching Ken's video, I have totally no idea that flying is a privilege that causes the biggest pollution than any other source. And I also agree with your justification for how impractical it is to use mass transportation. I think we can't maintain a balance between the speed and the harmfulness nor we should place on above another. It is then the question to ask: "should we reduce the frequency of flying?" Based on Ken's solutions for three types of flying categories, I think that these are all possible ways to solving the problem. it is true that a face to face meeting always brings about better outcomes than a virtual one but the virtue one could save people thousands of dollars or maybe hundreds of thousands a year that the money can be used in other development of a corporation. Regarding your last point of view for technology, I think we don't have the best and the possible technology to solve the pollution that flying brings about and that's the reason why we can only discuss a cultural change to all the possible pollution on this planet so far. It is the reason that human has less power in generation solutions than simply just polluting the planet. We are still on the way and I believe a cultural change is needed first before the technology comes out.


<br><hr>
I resonate with you on many points. Ken first points out that air travel only accounts for about 2 to 2.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally, but the title says flying is the worst thing people can do to the environment. It doesn't make sense why this is so serious. Also, I agree that the solution provided by Ken is a little unrealistic too. One of the popular reasons that people choose to take planes is that it's fast and saves time; otherwise, I won't spend so much money buying flying tickets if I have other options. I personally love to take buses and trains because they are more economical and more comfortable than cars and planes. I would love Ken to address those two points as well.
<br><hr>
I agree. Flying less will be very difficult for many people and probably impossible for many business people. It seems to me that just like the issue with planned obsolescence, the issue with flying is something that depends on or influences many aspects of our lives. Without a technological change in planes to make it more eco-friendly as you suggested, we may need to change many things within our culture: the way we travel (adapt our mindset to a slower lifestyle), the way we do business (allow more telepresence), should we eliminate first class/business class/flight privileges in order to get more people on the plane, what alternatives should we travel overseas (I believe that ships and cruises are just as bad as planes), etc.
     <br><br>
I also have similar concerns with regards to the carbon emission of the planes. It never occurred to me that taking a plane could emit so much carbon dioxide. I do think the numbers make sense, but it is rare for people to travel over such a long distance (like LA to Paris) or over a long period of time (like 24 hours). I would like Ken to explain the effect of plane travel in a more local scale, for example, traveling from LA to Arizona or some other cities within the U.S. (I believe it is more probable for regular vacation travel), and also a comparison between cars and planes over similar distances.

<br><hr>
I agree that it’s really upsetting to learn that flying and traveling, something that we do for leisure and to see our loved ones, impacts the environment so much. I myself also don’t fully understand the scientific background about how airplanes vs. cars and trains emit GHG. But I think the main point of this lecture was to question the cultural aspects that has led us to flying and specifically those who fly business and first class. We all live such fast paced lives and we feel like we need to be doing something every second of every day. When we relax, it’s seen as being unproductive and a waste of time. That’s the culture that has supported such a heavy use of flying. 
     <br><br>

In addition, I also agree that the slow travel movement seems unrealistic. But again, it’s a cultural issue that we should at least try to question and entertain the idea. As Ken mentioned, in other countries like Denmark, they only have 30 hour weeks and they can use that extra leisure time invested in things they actually like doing. In our case, if we didn’t have such a consumer capitalistic culture, maybe we’d be able to work less and spend more time to do things like leisurely travel on the train which is in fact much more relaxing than being on an airplane and safer than the car. Electric planes are possible but only for short distances. The technology of batteries for long trips still hasn’t been created in addition, batteries are often much heavier and less efficient than jet fuel. With the climate crisis that we face, technology may not be advancing rapidly enough for it to make any impact.
<br><hr>
Yes Ken hates trying to solve problems with tech, but tech may be the answer. I cant drive to south america to visit peru. There is a fine balance of making sure you dont ruin the enviroment, and still living a good healthy lifestyle and not missing out.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. Even though this video does give me a different perspective on flying, people are still going to do it. It is the most efficient and quickest way to get somewhere. Most people don’t have the time to do the methods ken suggested. Even as much as I wish there was enough time for that. Also, let’s be real Americans are lazy. If we are trying to travel somewhere most of us won’t want to do all those extra steps to help the planet. They will want to do what’s most convenient  for them at that time.
<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. The whole point of flying is time efficiency. 
     <br><br>

Imagine someone who worked hard for a year and would like to visit his parents during his 7-days vacation on Christmas. It is unrealistic to require him to spend 6 and a half days on slow traveling and leave as soon as he said hi to his parents. People don’t always have commands over the way they travel. In my opinion, if the number 2 metric tons per year restrains us to everything from owning clothes, food choice to means of travel, we might as well consider this issue from another view point.
     <br><br>

Perhaps, the biggest problem is that our earth can’t hold a huge population like this. The most urgent issue at hand is that we should educate the people in the third world countries and thus control the growth of population and offer a more desirable environment equally to each person.
<br><hr>
I agree with your take on why the video made you upset. Eventually, when I graduate and make enough money, I would love to travel. However, knowing how much flying contributes to CO2 emissions is making me frustrated because I do not want to contribute more to it, but at the same time I think it is important to travel the world and be immersed in different cultures and lifestyles. Traveling can also make you realize how much the United States is contributing to the climate crisis and persuade people to live more sustainable lives. Yes, I can travel by train or other slower forms of transportation, but this is just not efficient enough as flying, especially in the workaholic society we live in. There needs to be another way we are able to travel more efficiently without the major repercussions of flying. 
     <br><br>

In Ken's video I did resonate with one of his ideas to avoid flying for work. My dad often flies to Sacramento for important work meetings. If my dad was able to be tele-present for these meetings, it would be much more beneficial for the environment and more efficient in terms of not having to worry about travel delays. I think it is important that as a society we do not abuse flying. Having private jets, flying every day/week for work, or flying somewhere you could've easily drove are some of the first problems we need to eliminate before eliminating flying as a whole. I also agree that technology may be the answer to solving the problem of how much planes pollute our atmosphere. Strictly, getting rid of flying is not the best solution to this problem because it is simply not practical for today's society.

It never occurred to me that air travel is the worst thing for carbon footprint until I watch Ken’s video. Honestly I air travel a lot, because I like to travel and flying is the most convenient way for me. It saves time and energy. I actually feel guilty after watching this video as you do, and it also makes me sad that there is no way to travel efficiently without polluting so much. I do quite remember how many times I flied last year, but I would say it is more than 6 round trips, including 2 round trips back home. Ken is right about slow travel but it is very practicable for me. However, I would like to make efforts, such as carpooling or taking the airbus to LAX instead of driving on my own.

I see where you're coming from in this comment. I too really appreciate the whole process of flying. Getting to the airport, going through customs, waiting for your flight number to be called, getting snacks with a view, etc. But, I rarely ever fly, and when I do, it's for something I've been saving up for or the occasional family vacation. I too would like more information on why there is so much emission. Does the entire flight produce 450 tons of CO2?
     <br><br>
Slow travel doesn't seem practical to me either. If you only have a certain amount of days for vacation, why would you want to spend half of it traveling, probably the worst part of a vacation? Yes, you could argue that I should do it because I care about the environment. But, the last thing I'm thinking about when planning an amazing vacation is how to make less of a carbon footprint. Maybe that sounds selfish, but its the truth. I've heard of the trains in Japan (i think) that go extremely fast and cut train times in half. Do we have something of that nature here? I also think that electric airplanes should be something we focus on, because that would eliminate many of the problems Ken has with flying.



<br><hr>
I also believe that the slow travel movement wouldn't be practical for many. In my opinion, I know time is crucial for most of us since we do live in a fast paced society. I did find it appealing to enjoy the journey to the the destination, but I agree that there is difficulty in setting that extra time aside. I'm curious to hear Ken's responses to your questions.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you in how shocked I was by these statistics that Ken was discussing as they just seem outrageously terrible and more than cancel out any type of environmentalist living style one may participate in. Well theoretically saying Kens claimed statistics are true, flying just doesn't seem like a viable option at all for any type of long-distance travel with hopes of minimizing effects of climate change. Ken does suggest that we can take slow trips, such as taking the train for a week to get somewhere that takes a day on a plane or biking instead of driving, these ideas do sound like great fun maybe if you were a YouTuber or a student on summer break, but for the majority of people, it is just not possible with 5 day a week 9-5 jobs and limited vacation time along with tons of tasks needing to be completed each day. For this method to work on a large global scale, society as a whole must slow down. Focuses would have to be less on economic efficiency and more on happiness and peaceful living which sadly just doesn't seem possible at all at our current state which is why I believe the only way we can improve long-distance travel is just by converting to electric public transportation. Technology seems to be the answer in this case as an electric plane may produce some greenhouse gases during its production won't produce any more while it is in service which would substantially lower our co2 emittance. Electric bullet trains that can produce less greenhouse gases and get to their destination much quicker would be huge innovations. I'm not a frequent flyer by any means but I'm sure with these electric innovations our world would be at a much better place in this climate crisis and traveling may even become more accessible and affordable if we move to a slower-paced society.

This video was also upsetting for me. I take several trips a year by way of airplane and they are some of my most treasured memories and wildest adventures. I’m not going to lie it was difficult to hear that if I was in a room of 100 people, I would be contributing the most to the climate crisis as a frequent flyer. Other statistics, videos, and articles included in this class have left me feeling inspired and determined to win this fight against the climate crisis, and I have already made conscious personal decisions to contribute to the fight. But this was a hard pill to swallow. Like you said, traveling is my guilty pleasure and it seems almost impossible to regroup on how often I take trips. In this video Ken suggested ways of traveling that have less of an environmental impact, but a plane is still required to travel across oceans or if time is a factor in your travels. You made the important point that time often is a factor. We are in school or have jobs and that means we have limited time to take a trip. Taking a bus, train or electric bike might sound like a magical experience, and I am not denying that it is, but you are right that it is impractical. 

     <br><br>

I had similar questions to yours. I almost understand the climate denier movement after watching this video. It is so hard to accept the truth if it means change. We all get so comfortable and when we hear we have to give up some of this comfort for no immediate benefits, it is easy to be selfish. Even I started asking how me taking a plane a few times a year could have such a drastic impact on the environment and caught myself saying, “that can’t be true.” But it is true, and changes are mandatory. Until they develop a more efficient way of air travel it is important for us to be more aware of how often we fly and to use different ways of travel when we can.



<br><hr>
Yeah... I can totally understand your feeling after watching the video of this lecture. I am also a big fan of travel. By the time I saw that I cannot take planes to travel around the world, I am upset about the things I have give up. For a moment there is a thought comes to my mind: what the Earth now have become is because numerous people caring only about their own interests, and they unconsciously did something bad to our planet. Then I suddenly think that many of us are probably small version of those fashion and fossil fuels industries, and it is really horrible to think it. However, since I am an internationally student, I have to take airplane to go back to my country. If I take ship back to my country, it’s highly impossible since there is so limited time for me to meet my parents. So that there is limited things I can do for this part.



<br><hr>
I agree with all of these people, I feel guilty as well. I've flown multiple times throughout my life and now anytime I think about a plane or flying I feel bad. It is crazy how many tons of C02 you can add to your carbon footprint in such a short time. 3 tons in 24 hours...wow. I also agree with how people have been pointing out that this slow trip movement isn't practical. We would first have to shift our culture before we can even think about transportation. Humans have increased CO2 emissions by 1/3 just from the industrial revolution until now. Transportation and flying has most definitely contributed to that. Jet fuel releases tons of greenhouse gas emissions and when you trying to make something as big as a plane fly... the waste product is huge. We need to implement things such as bullet trains across the country and need to stop investing in our highways and air travel and invest in more environmentally favorable forms of transportation.



<br><hr>
I thought all these exact things during the video too. I feel like Ken really only addressed the extremes in this video. While I fly fairly often, it's at max for about 4 to 6 hrs and I always fly coach. It's unrealistic to sacrifice this for a multiple day train ride. And Ken most certainly embellished how enjoyable it is riding a train cross country, I can barely stand riding a 6 hr train to San Diego. But regardless, it is quite absurd thinking about how much I'm contributing to the climate crisis by merely flying on a plane for a few hours. I liked that last sentence you said because I feel like that's never addressed by Ken. Why just drop anything we're doing that contributes to the climate crisis when researchers and extremely capable people are making innovations daily? Planes provide us with so much and to merely stop our use of them due to a 2.5% effect on the atmosphere just seems like a stretch. I know this comment was kind of all over the place but this lecture left me so confused. I think on the grand scheme of things, flying does not need to be a major focus of correction in our fight against climate change unless it is in the form of technological advancement.



<br><hr>
About the fuel used on a flight, while I don't have sources for the exact amount of fuel used on flights, I would like to chime in about how a plane can use so much fuel. Air is a fluid, and as such there's a drag force to travel through it. On foot, we don't notice this effect whatsoever. On bikes on flat ground at high speeds, ~90% of your expended energy is used to literally push air out of the way. My experience bike racing tells me how important it is to stay in someone's draft so they are pushing the air for me, saving tons of energy. Also, drag increases as a factor of velocity squared. When considering how fast airplanes travel, it can quickly become apparent that aerodynamics, not weight, is the challenge. Airplanes have to therefore guzzle fuel (which may or may not be better/worse than car gasoline) in order to expend the immense amount of force it requires to keep the plane moving at speeds an order of magnitude higher than a car.



<br><hr>
I do agree that the slow trip is not that practical to do. As you said, people generally do not have time to spend a week on vacation just for travelling. It is difficult to convince someone to take a trip by an eight-hour train instead of a one-hour flight. In my opinion, what we could really do is to try to reduce the frequency of flying, and taking buses or trains when travelling a short distance, since there are no alternatives for planes on a long trip. I feel sad when I know that plenty CO2 is emitted for a 24 hours flight. As an international student from China, a flight from LA to Shanghai takes about 12 hours, so if I only go home during winter and summer breaks, I am emitting six tons of CO2, and I do not have other choices.



<br><hr>
This doesn't really come as a surprise to me. Considering how much energy is required in order to fuel a plane (especially for long 24-hour rides) and considering how many flights per day occur, it seems that planes would also emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. What must also be intensely costly in terms of carbon production must be to manufacture the entire plane on its own. As Ken mentioned in one of his earlier videos, car production, by itself releases an average of 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Considering planes are much bigger, I can't imagine how much their average carbon production must be.

     <br><br>

However, what I find interesting about this subject is that there is again no easy solution to resolving this. Even limiting the number of flights a person can have doesn't seem promising. Political leaders must be able to communicate face to face and fly to other countries for diplomatic measures. Popular artists must also go on tour to visit their fans. Even athletes must use planes to fly out to different competitions internationally. Businessmen and scientists also have to catch flights to go to international meetings. So many careers depend on worldwide communication which can sometimes only occur face to face. Putting restrictions on the number of flights a person can have in a year would severely hinder those people from exercising their careers.



<br><hr>
I used to only fly once or maybe twice a year with my family, but now that my stepdad is a pilot and we can fly for free, we fly as much as possible. We've taken this as an opportunity to visit family all over the U.S. and fly internationally for family vacations as well. I even started flying home to San Diego for breaks from college, because it's easier than driving or taking the train and it's free for us. I think that the trendy thing currently is Teslas, and electric cars, but no one is thinking about air travel as a contributor to climate change. I’m sure that many people like me see that, “air travel only contributes 2.5% of greenhouse gases”, and brush it off like they don’t have to worry about making any changes. But, if flying for 24 hours emits 3 tons of CO2 and our target for each person for one year is 2 tons, we're basically all screwed. The amount of times everyone is flying within America, or internationally, not to mention the use of private jets, seems astronomical. As much as flying is very convenient, the use of trains, buses, subways is now much more appealing. Like Ken said, we've had this infrastructure for so long and it still works very well, so why are we using teslas and electric cars as a solution to environmental problems. It's completely irrational for everyone to go out and buy new cars when we could all be taking the bus, biking, or even carpooling with friends, neighbors, or coworkers. And again, America as one of the most developed countries on earth is participating in 'the worst thing you can do environmentally' when '50% of people on earth have never even flown on a plane." It makes me sick and ashamed.



<br><hr>
Agreed! There is no way that the slow trip movement could be easily worked into people's lives. Many have jobs that require employees to travel a great amount and even pay for transportation fees. This is needed to get them to different work locations on a timeline. It would be hard to imagine a company that runs on the slow trip movement. I am sure that productivity is a set back for them since all of their time is spent traveling instead of a speedy flight. 

     <br><br>

Does the slow trip movement account for emergencies? Last-minute plans? It just simply isn't practical unless one had all the time in the world to get from place A to place B (which no one has the luxury of).




<br><hr>
I get what you’re feeling - I love to travel, and because my dad and much of my family lives in Iran, I take international flights quite frequently. I also care about the environment and my carbon footprint, so having knowingly contributed to carbon emissions in such an immense way is giving me a guilty conscience. However, I don’t have the time to take a train to New York and fly to Iran from there in between the fast-paced quarter system that we have.
     <br><br>
It might not be a feasible task to convince everyone to take extended trips every five years instead of shorter yearly trips, or to take a train all the way to New York in order to fly to Europe. The slow trip sounds like a nice idea, but the reality is that our society is too fast-paced for people to take slow trips as an alternative method. People do have other obligations that make these slower but more environmentally conscious methods of travel impractical, if not impossible. A more attainable way to reduce our overall carbon footprint would be to encourage people to fly economy only if they must fly at all, and to discourage usage of private jets, as people who travel in those ways have a much more massive carbon footprint than those who fly economy. Electric planes could be another viable alternative - even though the environmental impact of manufacturing these planes will still be great, they may work better than trying to convince the world to not fly at all. And if the trip is short enough to allow it - such as from Santa Barbara to San Francisco - then taking the train is always a better option. But with this issue, individual circumstances plays a bigger factor than other things we are doing to affect the environment.



<br><hr>
I also felt a bit upset after watching this video because I love to travel and fly several times every year. It was pretty sad to learn how much CO2 is emitted when flying. I agree that the slow trip movement is a good idea but is not very practical. Most people do not have the time to take several more days for travel because of work or school. It could also be less cost efficient than just flying. Some places like traveling out of the country would be extremely difficult to get to without air travel. I believe there are definitely some cases where I can choose to take the train or car instead of a plane, so that is something that I will be considering now when the option is available. Though I don’t think me choosing to take the train instead of the plane will make much of a difference because the plane is set to fly anyways. It will take a lot of public awareness before there will be a noticeable change in flight frequency. I think working to change air travel so that planes do not create as much pollution is a great idea.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. I love to travel, and usually my favorite form of transportation is by plane. But at the same time, with all this information, I now feel guilty doing so since I also actually care about my carbon footprint and the world I live in. While I think that statistics can get kind of messy, I don't doubt that planes, especially private jets and larger aircraft, emit a lot of CO2. I know a truck emits a lot more than say a small Mini Cooper and they're both relatively on the same scale of size. But when you bring in these double decker triple row airplanes carrying cargo and flying towards the sky at high speeds, I give the statistics the benefit of the doubt. 
     <br><br>

However, I also don't really think the idea of slow trip movement is always practical. Like you and others have said, schedules are usually very packed and people have to get places quickly. That's not too easy when it would take you days to get somewhere that you could've gotten to in a few hours by airplane. Society is pretty fast paced, and it'd be hard to keep up. I do enjoy the idea of a slow trip though and enjoying what there is to offer, but it sounds more practical for a vacation to me. Your idea of changing up technology is interesting though, and I like it. I've never really thought about it that way, but it'd make sense that if we can evolve our cars and homes to be more green, then why can't we change our air travel? Definitely something I think innovators should take a look into.


<br><hr>
I agree with you on a lot. It's true that air travel emits an insane amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere when compared to other forms of travel. However, what is the
solution? To write off air travel as not necessary or something to simply ban is not
reasonable or realistic at all. In all honesty to fix this problem there has to be an
alternative superior to our current air travel that is cleaner in it's emissions. Like you mentioned, the slow trip movement isn't practical. People don't have the time or money to be adding
additional travel days on their trip. It also isn't evident that slow travel is cheaper than
flying when you account for wages lost when you take extra days off for travel. There
is going to have to be an introduction of an air travel alternative that is cheaper 
consumer and producer side that is also cleaner to realistically fix this problem.
Electric planes, like you mentioned, are an interesting alternative but in their current
state are just not viable and probably won't be viable in the near future. Batteries are
incredibly space inefficient as an energy source and are exponentially heavier as an
energy source when compared to fossil fuel counterparts, making batteries undesirable
as an energy source for flight when compactness and weight are incredibly important
for lifting something off the ground and flying it through the sky.

I agree with you. This video made me upset as well. Not upset at Ken, but upset at our current technology and disregard for the environment. I now feel like everything else I do to help the environment is for naught: going vegan, buying everything secondhand, composting, recycling, reusing etc. etc. I have already flown in 2020 and I after watching this lecture I will not fly for the rest of the year.
     <br><br>
i also agree with the second part of your comment, these solutions Ken gives are not practical. Most people have full-time jobs or other responsibilities that they cannot maneuver around so easily to make time for "slow" travel, however great and leisurely it seems. I think we do have the technology to change air travel so that flying is more environmentally friendly, but not very many people are aware of the detrimental impact of flying (I definitely was not before this video) so there is no pressure on big industries to invent a new type of airplane.
     <br><br>
However, I am aware that I am speaking from a privileged point of view. I have only flown in my life because my parents have had the money to buy plane tickets and fund vacations. I am sure I would not be upset if I had not flown at all. Thinking about this made me more upset at myself for feeling upset! I should think on this more.





<br><hr>

I couldn’t agree more, learning about the detrimental impacts of flying really is devastating. Traveling is one of my all-time favorite things to do, and have been traveling as much as possible. Sadly,  I have often encouraged others to do the same. Out of all of the recommendations Ken has given us about how to reduce our personal climate footprint, this is undoubtedly the worst and hardest one for me. For me, traveling is really the best form of education, nothing compares to learning about different cultures and connecting with people from all of the world. Yet, is it really worth it in the end if the act of flying is the worst thing that you  could do for the planet? If 19/20 people in the world have flown in their lifetime, it must not be a necessary part of modern life. And if we must travel, there are always other ways to do so. Ken’s recommendations on how to reasonably cut down on flying really resonated with me. If you go on vacation, just go less often, and when you do, stay for as long as you can before coming back. This concept totally makes sense to me, and also seems reasonably and very easy to get behind. I think that simply solutions like these really will revolutionize the way we as a society fly, which would have an immense impact on the the climate crisis.





<br><hr>

I found this comment very interesting. I've flown across the world a significant number of times. Not too many, but enough to see various different countries and cultures that I would not have been exposed to had I stayed in my small town in the central valley of California. It's jaw-dropping to think that every time I go on one of these trips I'm helping to emit tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. It almost breaks down to, no matter how environmentally conscious you are it doesn't matter if you want to treat yourself to vacation once a year or even once every couple of years. 
     <br><br>

The slow modes of transportation are better for the environment, but what does that mean for travel overseas? It's just more logical to take a quick flight then days long boat trip. Even traveling across the country would take days or weeks. I understand that flying doesn't help the environment at all. But at what point do you sacrifice the environment for convenience and vise versa?





<br><hr>


While this video was very informative on the effects of air travel (much of which I was not aware of), I agree that the concept of the slow travel movement is not a very practical solution. As you mentioned, it is not possible for many people to add on a few days of extra travel when they have limited time away from obligations such as work and school. Additionally, Ken mentions a trip from LA to Paris as leaving a huge carbon footprint. However, the slow travel movement does not address this issue, as it is almost impossible to travel overseas without airplanes. I have a lot of family across the world and I would never have the time to visit them if it weren’t for the convenience of air travel and there is no way of getting around that obstacle. 
     <br><br>
As much as I agree with the fact that technology cannot solve many of the issues Ken has been addressing, I do believe that this is one issue where there is no other practical alternative and that we should be looking for technological solutions that reduce the emissions of air travel. 

     <br><br>


Apart from this, I do agree that a lot of business travel is unnecessary air travel and I support Ken’s solution to move these interactions primarily to telepresencing. Technology such as facetime and skype, along with many platforms that allow for screensharing and editing, are just as effective in conducting business meetings as face-to-face interactions are. Additionally, because air travel for these short, and most often impersonal, interactions are very tiring and force people to spend precious time constantly going back and forth between airports for no reason, I would argue that this solution would actually be beneficial and save time and money for people and companies.




<br><hr>


This lecture video really upsets me too because I love traveling and flying is such a convenient thing for me to realize my dream— to travel around the world. Through this lecture, I learned that every time of flying would release tons of CO2 to our environment. It is not a small number. I do care the environment as well, but giving up traveling around is a hard decision. I know that Ken made it less about feeling guilty and more about finding ways to travel with the smallest impact on the environment. However, for the countries  far away from us, traveling in slow trip is hard to realize. First of all, it’s time-consuming. Second, comparing to take flight, traveling in trains combined with other commute ways is actually more expensive. I also hope that there will be plane producing less CO2 in one day.



<br><hr>


While I definitely see where you’re coming from about almost feeling hopeless over traveling because despite being as environmentally conscious as possible in other aspects of our lives, it can all very easily be taken away or erased with one trip to a faraway country. I agree that there were many things that I think Ken could have expanded on because I too was left with even more questions than those I had entered with when starting to watch this video. I wondered how air travel compared to the effects of traveling solely by car everywhere.
     <br><br>

However , I would have to disagree with your comment on slow travel and it’s impracticality. Of course, not everyone can afford to go by slow travel every time they go somewhere that’s further than a few hour long drive, and as you pointed out almost everyone has obligations that don’t allow them the luxury of slow travel. But, I do think that if let’s say a person traveled through air travel abou 3 times a year yet was able to at least fit in time to do it by slow travel one of those 3 times, it would still play a great role in reducing their carbon footprint that is already high.





<br><hr>

I, too, felt a sense of anger and guilt after watching this lecture. I love to travel and I have flown internationally about four times within the last two years. I feel like there is a bit of irony to the situation because the places that I have travelled to have opened up my eyes to a range of environmental issues and have only fueled my fire to do something about them. Yet the very act of getting to those places where I get that sense of inspiration is contributing so much to the most pressing environmental concern, the climate crisis. I think this ties in with the idea of privilege. Especially when you consider the fact that 19 out of 20 people will never step foot on a plane. The fact that I have been lucky enough to fly and travel really hones in on the inequities that exist. I wouldn't even consider myself to be a wealthy person. I am a college student that works a part time job 25 hours a week to make my living, yet there is a level of privilege that needs to be acknowledged her and addressed in a way that humbles you enough to understand your role in the situation.

I am a frequent flyer.
     <br><br>
I live in the New York area, and am a freshman here at UCSB. I don't know how many flights per year constitutes frequent flyer status, but due to my home being in one of the furthest possible points without being outside the country, I have an absurdly high number of miles. I generally fly cross-country about six times a year (if I go home three times). That's about 18,000 miles of aircraft flight. By the time I graduate, I'll have chalked up at least 72,000 miles in the air. 
     <br><br>
I don't feel good about it, but I don't see myself taking the LAX to NY train regularly. Ken is right about slow travel and how it can be a completely positive experience. However, the main concern is putting aside those extra days. Due to the quarter system, I generally have to be ready to start work back home as soon as school lets out, or else my job goes to someone else. Putting aside that kind of time is easier said than done. I would definitely like to drive home at some point, though.
     <br><br>
I also definitely feel conflicted about considering myself an environmentalist. Do I have the right to claim such a thing when my carbon footprint is currently multiple times that of the average person? I've stopped eating beef, I buy almost all my clothing secondhand, and as a UCSB student, I obviously bike everywhere. But I find myself wondering: what's the point? Considering how much I fly, I may as well get a Big Mac, go on a shopping spree, and start a forest fire.

I feel for you a bit. I luckily live in LA so slow travel would be fine for me, but for your case it is not that easy. I did not quite consider this when I watched the lecture video, but reading your comment made me see the situation in a different perspective. Yes, flying is bad, but in some cases it is unavoidable. I guess people could just say to go home less, but that is of course easier said than done. I want to go home all the time and as fast as possible, if I were you and I could go home to NY, I honestly would. Even if it meant flying. Although, for the rest of what you do to reduce your carbon foot print I say keep doing it. It is hard for all of us to become full on environmentalist, but we all can do what we can.

I do agree that it is very difficult to try to be environmentally friendly when you have very few realistic transportation options besides flying for very far distances. If there was a system of buses or trains that went far distances from between states from California all the way to New York, that would give people more options to get to where they need to go but with less emission of greenhouse gases. Of course it would probably take much longer to travel than by plane, but I think the sacrifice of some extra time is worth it if it can help the planet. I think it is incredible that you have and other people have taken the initiative to make lifestyle changes to lower your carbon footprint as much as you possibly realistically can in your situation. Think of it this way yes unfortunately you need to fly to get back home, but imagine if you flew and constantly bought new clothes, drove around santa barbara instead of biking and ate beef every day how much more that would increase your carbon footprint. I think people should not be discouraged to be environmentally conscious if they can not change every aspect of their life to lower their carbon footprint, but it is important that people do try to lower it as much as they can realistically, like you mentioned perhaps avoiding things like shopping sprees.

<br><hr>
I understand your situation and concern. I have a more serious situation. Since I am an international student from China. China is farther than New York. It takes me twelve hours to take the plane. So it is impossible for me to take another transportation. If I am going to take a ship, the time might be up to one months. I have no better choice except the plane. I made a calculation about the number of planes between China and the US during my university life. It can be up to 16. I was astonished by this number. It may seem not that much, and the effect made by me taking the plane should be small. But if every international student had this number, the effect would be very large. I also feel struggling with myself. What I have been told is that planes will produce much pollution to the air, and the annual pollution produced by planes is very large. However, I have no other choice. Our system is quarter, the vacation is short. If I want to go back home, I can only take the plane. I want to be more environmental, but my current situation does not allow me to do what I want. I believe many people have a intention to be more environmental, but because of something they can not abandon, they choose to give up being environmental.
<br><hr>
I feel the same way.
     <br><br>

To be honest, I really don't know how to feel when watching this lecture.
     <br><br>

As an international student from Vietnam, I fly at least twice a year, 20 hours at a time, to see my family during breaks. The first two years I would get really homesick, so I would go home for winter break and during the summer. This video had really helped me understand how insanely privileged I've been to be able to do that, and how that privilege is contributing to the biggest issue concerning this planet, which pretty much goes against all of my values. Especially when this is something that I don't feel like I can do anything about.
     <br><br>

The fact is that my mom has worked so hard for me to get the best education, something that I can not get where I’m from. And if seeing my mom and my family is ruining the environment, then I don’t even know what to think anymore. Perhaps I don’t care about the environment as much as I thought I did.
     <br><br>

But I try. Honestly, I think that’s the best that anyone can do right now. I only eat beef once every few months now, I started buying secondhand clothing and bringing my own glass bottle to starbucks. I know it doesn’t seem like a lot, or even enough, but no one is perfect. I think trying and not being perfect is still better than not trying at all. Imagine everyone on this planet just gives up altogether and eats a ton of beef and buys like a hundred things from H&M, I think that would be quite disastrous. 
     <br><br>

I liked that Ken pitched the idea of slow travel. I thought it was bold might make people cringe or disagree, but it was radical, and that's good because we live in an age where radical solutions are needed. I might never come close to doing what Ken suggests, but it definitely inspired me to think hard about where I can contribute and how I can be radical in my own way.

<br><hr>
I feel as though a lot of people fall into this slump of "what's the point?". Not just in your case but for other things like climate change. Oh the world is already messed up so why not just keep doing what Im doing and do other things as well. Systems are put in place this way to make it so easy to do things that are harmful to the planet and everyone on it. It's important to visit your family, and it does suck that it comes at such a high environmental cost. Especially because you can't set aside so many days to travel since we are in school. But what's important to keep in mind is that you are aware of the damage being done and you can make better choices to lighten the load! When you get out of college make a choice to stop flying as much. For now see if you can take the train from LA to SB and when you go home see if you can fly in somewhere else and take the train the rest of the way. Although you can't do the train the whole trip you can cut down on plane mileage and that will help a lot! 
     <br><br>

There’s a story I wanted to share that I think is important when considering air travel. Last year my grandpa told me a story about how when he was a pilot in the Air Force they would make him dump extra left over fuel that they had while they were in air flying. The fuel would evaporate before reaching the ground but the components are still in the atmosphere! This story was insane, and I was like psh there’s no way planes are still doing that now. Yeah planes are still doing it now to this day. They say it’s because if they have left over fuel it is too heavy in the plane for it to land. And planes always carry more fuel than they need in case they have to stay up in the air to wait to land, so that means that planes are dumping fuel into the atmosphere almost every flight. That disgusted me and made me want to avoid planes even more. If 19 out of 20 people have not stepped foot in a plane then is it really that necessary? Aren’t there ways that we can fade out flying? The fact that 80% of all flights are made from about 1% of the population is crazy. It’s proof that we don’t need this luxury and the pollution that comes with it. We can do better.

<br><hr>
Me too. I am a frequent flyer as well. I have to fly between China and America four times a year. And I go everywhere by airplane except SB to LA. For my trips flying back home, I cannot think another way to do it because there is a pacific ocean in between and I do not think it's safe to take a ship. And for my other trip, I just did my own calculation and thought it's cheaper to take an airplane rather than driving. I understand the pollution created by my travel, but I cannot stop doing it. I believe many people are like me: we know what we are doing currently is harming the environment but we just cannot take those away from our lives. I believe Ken is right that we do need to do something; sometimes slow creates good feelings too.
<br><hr>
Ok not that starting a forest fire is joking matter, but I definitely laughed at that. However, I completely feel this comment. My mom moved to MN after I graduated, so instead of driving a couple hours down to Huntington Beach, I currently fly almost completely across the country multiple times a year. This is horrible on my part, but it's not avoidable unless I want to stay here during breaks. 
     <br><br>
However, this makes you think. Like you said- If I'm not willing to give up going home for a couple weeks at a time, why should I have the right to tell someone to stop eating beef? Stop shopping fast fashion? This video made me feel really bad and made me think. Saving the planet is all about sacrifices, but I'm afraid that not enough people are willing to make the ones that matter.
<br><hr>
Agreed. The notion that you should take the LAX-NYC train over flying is ridiculous. Although I understand if you truly had the environment's best interest in mind this would be the correct decision, 3 days of travel instead of 5-7 hours is craziness. I think keeping air travel to a minimum, beef consumption to a minimum, and the amount of forest fires you start to a minimum are all good steps to take to do your small part in saving the environment. Complete elimination does not seem realistic for the average american- The bulk of the Climate Crisis needs to be addressed by our political leaders.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that as the world expands, we tend to see the destination as the start of our journey, and therefore overlook the longest part of our journey. I felt it when you said that you didn't know how to feel after watching. It's hard because the reasons we travel aren't bad ones, and it seems that by exposing flying for its detrimental effects, we are cutting ourselves off from opportunities that flying has given us. This is especially  tough if being cut off from those opportunities means a worse education or not seeing your family as much. I have family in Europe, and my mom takes us to see them seemingly frequently. It's hard to think that by doing this we are hurting the planet so much. I care so much about the environment, but it's not something I can compare easily to how much I care about my family. Those are two very different things in my mind. That's why I think it's better to focus on the issue itself which is flying. I really liked Ken's idea of doing less frequent trips for longer amounts of time. This plus using slow travel could make our lifestyles less harmful to the Earth, while not cutting these options off to us. That being said, it is still really hard to wrap your mind around, and it sucks.
<br><hr>
I completely understand your situation, even though I only live a solid three hours away from school. More often than not, I take the train to travel between UCSB and my hometown, but it always seems like an inconvenience to take, and I would much rather drive. I've tried to change my attitude on this, however, as I can now see the detriments transportation has on our environment due to this class. Its crazy to think of the amount of miles traveled by air as you mentioned. I can't imagine the amount for students who live farther or out of the country. I feel as though you could still consider yourself an environmentalist due to your other efforts, although I see where you're coming from. I'm sure that most people have certain areas that they fall short on in regards to making lifestyle changes to benefit the environment. For me, I am vegetarian and also shop secondhand, but travel by air fairly often on trips with my family or to visit my sister who lives in Washington. I think that if everyone had the attitude of giving up because they can't make one change, then no one would go through the efforts of being an environmentalist at all. There is definitely a point in doing whatever you can to decrease your carbon footprint, I think, even if it may not seem like much in comparison to the emissions you are partly responsible for.
<br><hr>
I feel the same as you do. As an international student whose home country is all the way across the planet, I fly no less than you do, and I’m not proud of it. Although I considered myself as an environmentalist, eating plant-based diet and consuming very little other than necessities, and I always tell my family and friends what are the things we should do to stop global warming; I don’t seem to have the right to tell them what to do now, because I might be the one who is emitting more greenhouse gases than my all my family members together. Honestly, every time I listen to a lecture about the environment, I feel that there are a lot more things I can do to save our planet and I feel very ready to put them into action. This time, however, I feel nothing but helpless. During vacations I would take train or other public transportations and I have cut down the number of times I go home per year to 2 returns. Obviously, I can’t take a train or ship from China to America, not if I don’t want to miss the final exam. Should there be no international students or students from relatively distant cities? I suppose that is not quite possible. 
     <br><br>
People might say, when it comes to harming your own benefit, you so called environmentalist will refuse the eco-friendly method. Well, I don’t see a solution to this problem. I don’t see an alternative to airplanes. I can’t even argue with that, even though I really do care our planet. However, if there are alternative resources that can power the plane instead of the fuels we are using now, this might help solve the problem. It might be more effective if we focus our concerns on finding renewable and sustainable resources than thinking about how guilty it is to take an airplane.

<br><hr>

Although I do not live in New York, I feel like I can understand how flying is a necessity for you. I feel like it would be an incredible hassle for you to exert methods of a "slow traveler." To have to plan for 3-4 days of commute each way in the middle of such a fast paced quarter system would be inconvenient and stressful. I think that it is good to be aware of the amount we travel and what sort of methods we use to travel short distances (i.e. carpooling) but in reality we will need to fly to accommodate some of the lives that we live.
<br><hr>
I completely understand where you are coming from and also find it difficult to totally call myself an environmentalist when not all of my actions hold true to what I am saying and believe. I often travel by plane and was not aware of its environmental impacts until recently. However, although I try my best to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle (not eating meat, shopping at thrift stores, using reusable materials over single use items, and riding my bike rather than driving), I think it would be extremely difficult to stop flying. Every summer I fly to visit my family in Canada and do not think it is something I would be able to give up. I do however stay for a three or so week period which as you mentioned is better than many short trips, but still has environmental implications. I do see the benefits of slow travel but don't think it would be feasible for me to make these trips due to time constraints, such as work and school, considering I already visit for threeish weeks and would need around another one for traveling. Although I recognize its negative environmental impacts I cannot deny that I will never fly again as it is very important for me to see my family when possible, although I will probably now think about flying less and consider using public transportation when possible. 
     <br><br>

One other problem I have with this video is that I believe that many people form an appreciation for the natural world when they are able to experience it. Just as your example with telecommunicating and face to face business interactions, I think people get a difference experience out of visiting a place rather than just seeing videos or pictures of it. I see how this would be ironic since visiting a place and forming an appreciation and sense to protect it and the planet could also be damaging the environment as a whole. Maybe one solution to this issue, as you mentioned, would be to travel for an extended period of time, if possible, using slow travel, and rather than making multiple shorter trips.

<br><hr>
I find connections with you that I am from China and I have to fly from China to L.A. This is worse than flying from NY to LA. I also feel guilty about that. However, just like you, I do not have other options either. I can not take a train from China to LA, just like you would not take a train from NY to LA. In this issue, we do not have many options. We know it is very bad for the environment, but we just have to do it. I do not agree with your second part that if flying is so bad, what is the point for us to eat less beef, ride a bike and so on. I believe it is because flying is so bad and we can not change it, we need to do better in other ways to make it up. It is like you fail you math class, you should not think like my GPA is already ruined, I should give up this quarter. Instead you should think like to A all my other class to make it up. We know it is small steps compare to flying, but if we do not do all things, we would not even have those small steps. little is still better than nothing.
<br><hr>
Well, maybe starting a forest fire is not the best solution, but maybe there are a few ways you can cut back, even slightly. While you maybe cannot take the train to New York because of work, maybe you could leave work a day or two early to come back to Santa Barbara and take the train back rather than flying. While you would definitely sacrifice convenience, you could cut your climate footprint almost in half through this method. Additionally, maybe only go back home once or twice a year, rather than three, or something to that effect. In no way am I trying to criticize you here, only trying to show the little things you could do to make a difference. I do not think environmentalists necessarily have to drop their footprint to zero right away, but rather just drastically reduce their impact on the environment through intentional action.
      <br><br>

In regards to your point about feeling helpless, I think that attitude is consistent with looking at a problem to generally. When I find myself with anxiety, I usually write down the specific tasks I have to do and then take them on one by one, rather than trying to solve it all at once. The climate crisis is really just a larger scale version. Reading all of these articles and watching all of these documentaries no doubt makes us all think this problem is huge in both scale and severity, making us feel helpless. If we just take it one issue at a time, or in your case one cross-country episode of travel at a time, it is much more manageable.
      <br><br>

Even if you just take the train one way from now until you graduate, your miles flown will drop by 36,000. While certainly not ideal, given your situation, it is definitely an improvement over the status quo, and in dealing with any large problem like the climate crisis, any improvement, no matter how small, is a victory.


<br><hr>
I honestly wouldn't feel to bad if I were you. To a certain extent you're simply at the mercy of your circumstances. While there are better options, and you mentioned a few, they would burden you with a much greater travel time, and consequently less time at home. 
      <br><br>
Even though your air travel might offset the other environmentally conscious actions/choices, there is still an impact to the environmentally positive decisions your making on our planet and the people closest to you.
      <br><br>
I'm very hopeful that transportation, especially across the country, will evolve into a more sustainable and efficient system in the coming decades. Perhaps one day you will have more options that don't make you feel guilty for travelling home.
<br><hr>
I definitely understand your concern about your travel habits. Although I only live a few hours away from UCSB, I often find myself choosing to drive back home rather than taking a train. Although the train would be the more environmentally friendly travel option, factors such as finding transportation to the train station, long travel times, and lack of privacy often push me towards choosing to drive home. I often feel guilty for choosing this option, but similar factors such as being able to spend more time with my family and being able to work more hours back home often weigh more than the environmental factors when I am deciding how to travel back home. Although Ken brought up a good point about environmental transportation options, I agree that it may not be the most viable option for people. Additionally, it is hard to replace personal interactions with things such as video-calling. I think that being aware of your own carbon footprint is a step in the right direction towards figuring out how to reduce your overall carbon footprint. Although not everyone is able rely on more environmental forms of transportation, making changes in the other aspects of your life can help reduce your overall carbon footprint. I think people should definitely make a switch towards using environmentally friends forms of transportation for short distances. Additionally, I think more should be done to make public transportation more attractive for the general public. Problems I have found in LA public transportation include incorrect scheduling times, overcrowding, and pricing. If these problems were addressed, I think more people would be willing to take public transportation.
<br><hr>
I'm in the same boat being from New Jersey and also a freshman here. I had never even thought about not flying out here before this video, but it honestly makes me feel guilty to continue to fly back to the east coast every break. I know how bad it is to the environment thanks to this video, but I can't see myself spending days on traveling when it could be done in only 5 hours, no matter the environmental consequences. For me, time is so important, but so is the environment. It really is such a conflict. I would definitely reconsider flying to places a little closer to home and within California, but it would definitely be difficult to make this big of a sacrifice six times a year. I thought about other options like not even going home during some breaks and exploring more of California, but that wouldn't solve the long breaks like winter and summer break.
<br><hr>
I share similar conflict within myself regarding being an environmentalist or not. While I don't fly as much, I do drive a car, and I use it to get back home to LA when I can. I realize having a car is both a privilege and also an environmental hazard, but I don't think it is feasible for me to give it up for public transportation. For one, as a young woman, traveling alone on a train or bus long distance is quite nerve-wracking to me because of past experiences. Also public transportation where I'm from (LA) is pretty bad. To me, driving is just more convenient. I realize that may sound selfish in regards to the environment, but I think it is unfair that the exceedingly wealthy class of individuals who take private jets everywhere and consume and waste egregious amounts of stuff get to do so meanwhile I, an individual with an incomparable carbon footprint to there's, has to sacrifice things that have almost become essential to American life. With that said, there are other ways, similar to you, that I have done to reduce my carbon footprint, as I rarely ever eat meat anymore, I stopped using single use plastics and got my family to do so as well, I don't purchase fast fashion goods, among other things. So, I also feel conflicted about even trying to consider myself an environmentalist, because while I try to pick up more environmentally friendly habits, I will still likely always have environmentally hazardous habits as well, as that is what living in America usually entails.
<br><hr>
What Downey says really makes sense, since I’m also a frequent flyer as an international student, who normally come home at least once a year for visiting my family. And honestly I never think of how flying can do  that much of harm to the Planet. This suddenly makes me think of when I attend all the SAT test aboard, since they don’t set test area in my country, I have to go aboard by flight several times just to take tests. Not to mention there are countless test takers like me who take the test aboard, I cannot believe how many wastes will there be, which is what us should be thinking of. If there are enough test areas in every country, does that mean a lot of people don’t have to fly aboard just for taking the test anymore?
      <br><br>

I like how professor talks about how can we do better without cancelling the flight. Either reducing the flight time, or just change a way of transportation, since it is actually understandable for people who have to take the flight and also we are protecting the environment.
<br><hr>

I don't blame you for thinking what the hell is the point of being vegan and buying things secondhand if your flights home alone contribute much more than the average person's yearly consumption in total. The only thing I could say is that while it is not practical for you to drive home or take the train, practicing your other eco friendly habits can inspire many others to do the same, and that it will all add up.
<br><hr>
I can fully relate to this comment. My parents are both from Europe and the only family we have all live in Europe. My parents are happy if they get to see their parents and siblings once or twice a year but that unfortunately often mean a flight all the way from LAX to Europe. They don't get very much time off of work and this makes travel by train close to impossible. As much as my family also tries to be environmentally conscious, there are some limitations to it with plane travel, as it is the one opportunity for the generations of my family to stay connected. 
      <br><br>
While in Europe, we often travel only by bike and train, as the public transport systems in Europe are efficient and bountiful, however the same opportunity is not always available in America. In countries like France, Germany, and Italy, the entire society is structured around the public transport, and it is normalized, and a form of transportation people can rely on to get to work, go grocery shopping, go into the city, or across town, however there would need to be a large scale structural transformation, for the same access to be available here.
      <br><br>
I believe that we should do everything we can to lessen our individual carbo footprint on the environment, however some solutions are more realistic than others.

<br><hr>
I understand where you're coming from Emmet Towey from Norwalk, CT. I can't exactly relate to your situation since I'm from Orange County where my home is only 146 miles away. I've flown across the country to Pennsylvania many times in the past and not once thought about my carbon footprint. You've come here for an education, and unintentionally contribute to the CO2 emissions that everyone else on the plane has too. It's not like you're flying in a private jet every weekend. Slow travel is obviously encouraged, but the opportunity costs of all that time is just not worth it in the end. By flying coach you're already reducing your footprint compared to first class, and I don't think you'll be receiving the worst planetary citizen award by flying in a passenger aircraft. The best you can do now is to not only try improving on the little aspects of life that reduce your footprint, but to also maintain those methods and practices for many years to come.

<br><hr>
I am in a similar situation. I have family in Puerto Rico that I go and visit every summer. I am not going to stop visiting them, therefore I am not going to stop flying. I guess the only thing I could do to reduce my carbon footprint would be to drive to bus to Miami and take a flight from there. However, ken failed to address the economic advantages of flying. Using a combination of trains and buses, It would take an extra 3 days to arrive to Miami. Given that this form of travel is much more exhaustive than an 8 hour flight, I'm going to add an extra day for physical recovery. That means that I am adding an extra eight days to my trip. Those are eight extra days that I will not be working. If I allotted all of my income from those eight days, I could almost finance my trip. Furthermore, the long distance buses, combined with uber costs to the bus station and meals during the road, end up being significantly more expensive than the cheapest flight. Therefore, as much as I would like to reduce my air miles I simply cannot afford to do so. If it were significantly cheaper to train or bus, I would consider it even with the extra days. For now, however, this remains another example of how a carbon tax and green subsidy would positively influence my choices as a consumer.

<br><hr>
As an international student, I feel the same as you. I have to fly at least twice a year and I have no choice. It takes too much time to take a boat. In my daily life, I use my bicycle or walk as much as possible. When traveling, I choose train or bus. Only in the summer, I can't avoid flying. I think I have done the best I can. Now I have an idea, can people invest time and money to develop a more energy-efficient aircraft? If this aircraft were invented, all humanity would be benefited from it.
<br><hr>
It is quite unfortunate with the amount of transfer students that go to UCSB, especially those that are enrolled in this class, that they are obligated to fly back home every break. A 14,000 mile to China round-trip alone can greatly contribute to your carbon footprint. Assuming they go home 3 times every year for 4 years, that is almost  170,000 miles in the air! Considering the amount of people attending this school that have to make this commute, that alone likely contributes thousands of tons of carbon dioxide into the air on a yearly basis. These trips alone have a higher carbon footprint than your average human(on a yearly basis). The idea that a single person can put that much waste into the air in a single 24 hour span, is simple astonishing to me, Like you said, I'm genuinely curious if there is a possible solution to the dilemma many of the transfer students face as a result of the demand for air travel.
<br><hr>
I am in the same situation myself. Being an out of state student certainly increases our carbon footprints. I travelled home to Texas 7 times last year, racking up about 21,000 miles of air travel. While this is considerably a lot, I don't think you should feel so guilty for going home by plane because there isn't really any other option. As you mentioned, taking other forms of transportation take way too long for the time the breaks are such as thanksgiving or spring break. In these cases, taking the train could account for about half of the break. I think a good solution would be to maybe drive or take the train for our longer breaks such as summer or winter break, and flying home for the shorter ones. 
      <br><br>
While flying home is an issue we should be conscious about because of the fact that we live far away, at the same time I don't really see it being any different than in-state student traveling out of state for vacations, or going to see family elsewhere in the country. We are not the only ones traveling to this extent. Essentially a great majority of the population who can afford higher education can also afford to travel by plane, making it a popular form of transport that has its consequences overlooked. While I find it unrealistic to eliminate our use of air travel completely, it is definitely doable to decrease it. In my situation, I am already taking active steps to do this. I am planning on going to Hawaii this spring break, and while I could have flown straight out of Santa Barbara to another airport, then to my final destination, I am instead driving to LA to take a non-stop to Hawaii. This way, I am limiting my air travel while also saving money.
<br><hr>
I really resonated with this comment as what I consider home is a 19-hour flight (Dubai, UAE). As you mentioned, regardless of the circumstances it is necessary to go home and if that means flying as it is the most convenient and suitable mode of transportation then so be it. There shouldn't be any objective scrutiny to this in my opinion.  Understandably, flying is great havoc to the environment but at the same time, the problem lays in the issue of there not being a close substitute for flying. Now Ken mentions the concept of slow travel however, although conceptually it may be fitting, practically and logistically there are still many discrepancies. In terms of finding a solution to the problems flying brings, I don't think that there is a practical solution out there that can be implemented on a large enough to mitigate the cons of imposing these policies. Although this can be viewed as a very "glass half empty" perspective I believe that it is the sad truth of flying.
<br><hr>
I completely relate to you, I have to return home every summer and Christmas break in order to see my family. Although I wish there was another way for me to travel to my country without harming the planet so much, it would be too dangerous to travel by a regular train or bus. This is why I believe the government should invest in a system like a bullet train in Japan, that would encourage people to stop traveling by airplane. If an option like this existed, so many people would travel on a train instead. This could be a solution to many problems as it would probably be cheaper, not faster but still fast, and safer as people wouldn't be thousands of feet in the sky. I hope we are able to pressure the government for more regulations on airplanes in order to start a change. A change that benefits us all and primarily the planet.
<br><hr>
Air travel is one way that I personally could improve quite a bit. I studied abroad in Denmark last year and travelled all over Europe for 11 months and after watching this counted my miles and it ended up being over 20,000 miles. This is something I’m going to try to change. Instead of going to Asia after I graduate in June I might try to travel by train all over north America. It will probably be cheaper and easier anyway so I can help and do the right thing all at once.

As someone who wishes to travel in the future, I thought that this video would make me doubt whether or not I deserve to satisfy my desires of wanderlust at the expense of the environment. However, Ken made it less about feeling guilty and more about finding ways to travel with the smallest impact on the environment. My dreams are to go Ireland, Spain, Italy, and Switzerland. In fact, earlier today I was thinking about how I could go to each country every summer for four years. However, after watching this video, I am inclined to make my Europe visit a one-summer adventure. I would fly to Switzerland, then take a train to Italy, then a train to Spain, and a ferry to Ireland. Ken said that "instead two short vacations that require flying every year, why not have one grand one every five years?" If I follow Ken's advice, I will feel less guilty when I fly to my dream destinations and I will enjoy and appreciate the trip a lot more.
      <br><br>

In terms of finding a solution to the issue of flying, I feel as though personal/private jets should be banned, as they are completely unnecessary. I also feel as though the amount of times a person flies in an airplane should be limited. We could limit this by increasing the price of air travel, or we could limit this by decreasing the price of other forms of travel such as trains, buses, or boats.

I agree, and I can relate to your desire to travel around the world. One of the plans I made with my sisters for once we're older was to fly to a starting point in Europe and then spend a couple of months flying consecutively to other countries. However, now that Ken mentioned it, I see that it is also possible to just take a plane once and then travel the shorter distances by train. This would be less harmful to the environment, and it would also give us a better experience of the place we're visiting.
      <br><br>

Even though flying has a huge negative impact on the environment, I do not think we could get rid of it altogether, and I don't think we should either. I agree with your idea that private jets should be banned, and I also like your idea of limiting how much a person travels. I also think that in order to get more people to give up air travel, our bus and train systems have to improve. More stops and routes need to be added so that travelling is more efficient, and more appealing.

I think many people, especially those that are our age, can relate to having the desire of traveling the world and experience new places via airplane.  However, I think many people are unaware of the utter destruction it brings about the planet and that there are in fact solutions to minimize the impacts to the environment.  This is why Ken's message on bringing about awareness of the harmful nature of air travel is extremely important and should be introduced into more students' lives.  I also agree with your statement that personal/private jets should be banned, as they serve no purpose other than to flaunt someone's social status and wealth.  Many celebrities that own private jets are either completely oblivious to this fact or do not feel the need to give up their symbol of wealth and luxury.  This is an unfortunate factor in our society and will only change if our values are changed.
<br><hr>
I agree with the banning of private jets as I feel like its so excessive. If filling a plane with all those uncomfortable seats is still environmentally unfriendly, I can't imagine how much damage a plane holding 1-5 people would do. Also, limiting the amount of times a person can fly is such a great idea. This made me realize all the commercials we see rewarding people for flying. Many companies offer frequent flyer promotions and incentives to get you to fly. Instead these ads should be banned as we are just convincing people to ruin the environment. We should see more ads about trains and promoting them to the public to get people to go on them more often. Along with this, I believe businesses that send their employees on paid business trips should pay for their ticket, but by train. Allow your employee to leave work a few extra hours/days than normal so they can take the train to the destination rather than plane. The business will save money as the train ticket for their employee is much cheaper than the plane ticket they would have to pay, and since they adjust for the time difference, the employee still arrives to the business meeting on time with a more environmentally friendly result.
<br><hr>
I think your point about banning personal/private jets is really valid and would help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. However, I do not think that banning them outright would be viable. Instead, I think that governments could do things like place very high taxes (like a carbon tax) or some other strict limitation on private jets to deter their frequent users. I have often wondered about why people feel the need to use private jets when first class exists? I know some people may argue that private jets are taken for security and speed, but often times when we see people online using their private jets, it often seems like it's just for the flex. 
      <br><br>
I also agree with your desire to travel in the future, and I think so many people of all ages feel the same way. I found Ken’s proposal for slow travel to be very appealing, because it seems like it would allow people to fully experience their travel, rather than deal with the rush and stress of an airport. Although this plan sounds great, I know it is not very realistic, because not everyone can afford to take so much time away from work just for the travel portion of the journey. In addition, I liked Ken’s idea about taking one big vacation every five years instead of every year. However, some people do not have the type of job that would allow them to take three weeks to a month off. What are the feasible means of vacation for those people?
<br><hr>
 that’s a very interesting point! When I thought of a big vacation every couple of years rather than short vacations every year, I was thinking about the life schedules of students and teachers, the people with whom we currently spend most of our time. Students and teachers would be able to take these larger vacations (over winter break or over summer vacation). However, you’re right -- other people might not have the same opportunities. I’m sure the fight to solve this issue could transcend environmental science and could enter the workforce. Perhaps we need to be considering a change in work schedules and even lessening the amount of work hours (whether this be per day or per year). In the end, this would improve happiness, promote more productivity, and allow for longer vacations and trips!

<br><hr>

I felt the same way. I have never travelled outside of California and thought this video would make me feel guilty if I were to ever fly but Ken does provide good solutions! The idea of one big vacation did seem like a lot of fun and the way you described it to made me think it is possible. I think we can travel as long as it is reasonable and not harming the planet thanks to the video.
      <br><br>
I think decreasing the prices of other forms of travel would be a good solution as well because people will be more inclined to use that option oppose to others and also allow people more freedom to keep traveling. I don’t know if I agree that price air travel should be pricer because when I think of traveling I know that it could be the quickest option for someone to get somewhere and in case of emergency it would be the best option for someone.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I also appreciate how Ken did not focus on trying to make us feel guilty, but tried to inspire us to find solutions to the consequences of air travel. I do believe that in this day and age, it is impossible to completely eradicate air travel. Many people's jobs rely on business trips to far away countries such as China or Korea, and there is simply no way to get there except by plane. Additionally, air travel has connected the world in many ways and provided millions of people with the opportunity to see parts of the world they never could've hoped to see otherwise. Travel broadens our knowledge and acceptance of other people and their cultures, so I think it is important that we do recognize the benefits of airplanes. 
      <br><br>

That being said, we cannot take advantage of such a convenient travel method without recognizing the consequences. As Ken stated throughout the video, airplanes emit a lot of CO2. If we are traveling somewhere close within the continent, we should try to the best of our abilities to go by train, bus, or car. I agree that whenever we do need to fly, it should not be on a private jet as these use up a ton of CO2 per person and are excessive and unnecessary.


<br><hr>

I also wish to travel, however not only to one country but several countries in South America. This video put me into a debate whether I should travel or try to minimize it to once every 5 years. I recently travelled to Peru by myself to visit my family, especially my grandparents who are in their 90’s. I went for three weeks however those three weeks went by quickly, and I plan to go for either all of summer or for two months. After visiting them I would want to go every year instead of every five years to go see them, we facetime and text very often, but it is not the same when you are spending time with your family and you rarely see them. It would be hard for me to reduce my carbon footprint in this aspect of air travel.
       <br><br>

I don’t think we can ever get rid of flying but I think that famous abuse their wealth into buying private jets and helicopters to get from point A to B. I get it, it is faster and more convenient for oneself. But the planet suffers greatly from this. I don’t know what we could do about that. Maybe increase prices but wealthy will probably be willing to pay more in order to keep their private jet.


<br><hr>
I have the same plans in regards to traveling in my future. I would love to see more of the world and expand my knowledge on different cultures and places, but it is discouraging to hear how the environment can be damaged by my own wants. I also liked Ken's idea of making one large vacation instead of a few smaller ones, and I think the trip you planned out would be just as amazing as taking those trips individually. Private jets, in my opinion, are useless. Banning them would be so beneficial, yet the people in power who make those decisions are likely the exact people who would use a private jet. I saw recently that someone was mocking a celebrity for being on a plane, and said they couldn't afford a private plane, so they should be embarrassed. This was so ridiculous to me, as people are willing to damage our environment for their own image to be maintained. This is a problem that needs to be fixed, as we can not be hurting our own planet for such selfish desires.
<br><hr>
As someone who wants to travel to many different countries in the future I also though that I would feel super guilty. However, I completely agree with what professor said. Taking a grand vacation would be so much better for the environment rather than constantly traveling every year. I feel like many people from my generation, and me as well, see the lives of many influencers or celebrities who travel all the time and we tend to want that. It can be very easy to get caught up in the world of social media and not realize that what these people are doing is having such negative impact on the environment. 
       <br><br>


Although, I agree that one person not traveling as often would have a good impact on the environment what would have even a greater impact would be getting rid of private jets. I also like the last point you made of decreasing the price of other modes of travel. That could have a significant impact and convince many people to use things like the train to travel.

<br><hr>

 I felt very similar as you did when I watched this lecture. I haven’t traveled much in my lifetime and when I saw the title, I instantly thought “Well there goes my wishes to travel this summer.” I enjoyed how Ken provided solutions to air travel instead of merely providing the fact that traveling via airplane is the worst possible thing you could do. Now that would be a very depressing video. I am currently planning my trip to Europe this summer and this video came just in time. I just bought my ticket to get to Europe and now I am looking towards taking a train to the places I want to go. To comment on your idea of banning personal/private jets, I couldn’t agree more. Banning would be great for the environment, however I don’t think the local or federal governments would care to fix this.

<br><hr>
I agree. At first, it made me feel like I could never explore the world one day and all its wonders. However, he made the statement saying to take less frequent vacations but longer and grander ones. So I now feel less guilty when I will fly in the future.
<br><hr>
I do think that your plan sounds fairly amazing, for both the environment and for yourself. Creating a trip that will have all of your destinations you've wanted to go to, alongside impacting the environment very little allows for there to be the best of both worlds in a sense. However, the one issue that comes to mind is if your work and routine in life would allow that to be a possibility? Once a job is obtained, the workforce, depending on where you have a job, might limit your desire to do this trip. Such as the time limitation that either school, work, or personal life will impose on you. I also stand with your statement that private jets and planes should be banned unless they pay a carbon tax.

<br><hr>
I also had plans to and would love to travel more in the future. I also think Professor Hiltner did a great job with not guilting me into feeling like I should not travel anymore. I like the alternative that he proposed where if one does travel, one can make it a longer single trip instead of multiple smaller trips. I would also like to travel to Europe and I think I now plan on trying to go to multiple nearby countries by train instead of making several plane trips. I think your solutions to the issue of flying are great ideas. Private jets are definitely not necessary, and we could try to limit air travel by altering the prices of air travel and other forms of travel to promote more environmentally friendly modes of travel.
<br><hr>
Just like you, I wish to travel to different countries around the world that I have never visited. This is a big thing for me on my bucket-list, and I am pretty sure it is big for others who have not been wealthy enough to travel around the world in airplanes. I am glad that Ken has suggested having big vacations with bigger time gaps in between them because that is something I could do. The first country that I wish to travel to is Guatemala. Following Ken’s advice, I would travel, once I’m financially ready, to Guatemala, and then five years or more later I would take another vacation. 
       <br><br>

 I agree that private jets should be banned, but I don’t think they ever will. Celebrities and wealthy people pay a lot for these jets, so the people who sell/rent them out would not like to lose out on all that money. Limiting the amount of airplane trips a person could take would be a great idea but again I unfortunately do not see this happening. Trains and buses are already comparatively cheaper, and increasing the price of airplane trips won’t really affect these wealthy people who have too much money anyways.

<br><hr>
I have the same dream of one day traveling the world and experiencing different places and cultures I have never seen before, but after watching this lecture video it made me think how I should fulfill these desires without adding more damage to our environment or if I should even consider traveling at this point. My dream has always been to go to Europe but this can only be done by flying or driving and traveling by sea which I can't possibly imagine how long of a journey that would be. Like you and professor Ken mentioned instead of traveling every year it would be better to plan a grand vacation every five years, which I can definitely see myself doing in the future. One of my other plans before watching this video was to study abroad, but at first I didn't realize how much this was going to impact my carbon footprint. Now that I'm more aware of climate issues and the consequences it can produce my desires have been limited and I am willing to make some sacrifices like changing the way I eat to a healthy lifestyle and buying fewer clothes. Also, I completely agree with you on the aspect that public transportation should be cheaper for people to be able to afford them and therefore this will overall make people want to take the bus more than spending so much on gas. I think another contribution our country should make is making roads more suitable for buses and bikes. People sometimes don't want to ride their bikes because there aren't sufficient bike lanes and they feel unsafe or there aren't enough buses during the time they have to depart. However, changing this, adding more buses and bike lanes to our roads can definitely decrease the amount of pollution we add to the atmosphere when driving.
<br><hr>
it amazed me when ken said that only 2% of global CO2 emissions were caused by airplane travel, for something so seemingly devastating, how is it so bad? But I understood more when he discussed the topic on a person to person level. I honestly never put much thought into airplane travel in accord with climate change, but the idea of 3 tons of CO2 being emitted from 24 hours of flying was startling. The idea that a single person could put that much CO2 into the atmosphere in that amount of time if terrifying, and the time may seem like a lot but when broken down it's really not that much time. I'm currently not a frequent flyer and never have been. The only time I had been on an airplane has been from a two-way trip from Cali to Texas to visit family, both rides being 3 hours, so in my life so far I have (only counting air travel) .75 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. It's scary to even think about that, and for my future travel plans.
       <br><br>

 I've always dreamt of traveling to different countries too, and all along the United States so the lecture put a damper on my traveling spirit, but I appreciated ken talking about a few different methods of transportation where we can still get to where we need to go, just not in the fastest or "efficient" way. Especially in making a single large trip instead of a few costly ones every year or few years. I can now plan to make a trip to Europe in a couple years, and many down the road make subsequent trips based in a few areas locally i can travel to.


<br><hr>

This lecture also made me completely reconsider the way I’ve always thought about travel. In my mind, the only alternative to traveling by plane to faraway destinations has been road trips, which I kind of despise. However, the slow travel movement really appeals to me, especially as a way to make a vacation about much more than the destination. Although the trip will take much longer, as Ken mentioned, I believe my memories of the experience will be so much richer than they would be if I was sat in a car or plane for hours on end, bored out of my mind. The opportunity for richer experiences combined with the much smaller environmental impact of slow travel make me extremely excited to incorporate train rides and other forms of transportation into my future travel plans.
       <br><br>
I really like the solutions you proposed to flying - I feel that lowering the cost of public transit and increasing the cost of flights would be an effective motivator for people to change their habits. I’ve only taken a few plane rides in my life, but I cringed as I heard that just one of them would equal my CO2 allotment for a year and a half - meaning I’ve certainly made my environmental footprint skyrocket just with those flights. I also admittedly saw private jets as glamorous and enviable, but with the knowledge of their detrimental environmental impact, I will never think of celebrities who show off by posting to instagram from the steps of a private plane the same again. I wouldn’t oppose a ban on private jet use in the slightest.

<br><hr>
I liked what you said about how Ken made you feel like it was less about feeling guilty and more about finding solutions. I think this is one of the thing people get wrong so often about environmentalism. Well meaning friends and relatives who know I'm taking environmental courses are always asking me "so what did you learn we shouldn't do/eat/buy this week?" Now I have plenty of answers for them, but I also make sure to emphasize what we can do. Often times, it feels like "everything" is bad for the environment. The reason it feels like this is because environmental destruction is so hegemonic in our society that we fail to realize there are many things that can be done so differently. From fears that slowing consumption will tank the economy, to concerns that we won't be able to travel anymore, people simply don't get that there are other ways of doing things. That's what I like about Ken's class, he gives us real solutions.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with where you are coming from. It is my dream too to be able to fly to a lot of different countries and travel the world while I can. Some of the places that I would like to be able to visit are France, Japan, and Switzerland. Upon watching this video, I was a bit disappointed because I had no idea how I would be able to fulfill that dream without increasing my carbon footprint. However, according to what Ken said, it does make sense to take one huge trip instead of taking multiple short vacations every year. Then, I too would feel less guilty about my carbon footprint and be able to enjoy everything these countries have to offer. 
       <br><br>
The term of telepresencing that Ken brought up is true that is something that I can do to be transported across great distances without having to emit that carbon footprint myself. However, that cannot be the case for all instances such as when I want to experience these sights up close such as the Eiffel tower in Paris. This is why I will try this method for everything that I can such as business meetings and interviews but for traveling, I would like to be able to see these sights in person and experience all that life has to offer.

<br><hr>
I think myself and arguably everyone else watching this video can relate to this a lot. Realizations like this are one of the reasons this class scares me a little bit; I'm worried I'm going to have to curb lots of my desires in order to be more responsible for myself and my impact on the environment. However, the concept of having one huge trip every few years is much more eco-friendly than multiple European vacations per year. Hopefully many people will follow suit.

Thank you very much for appreciating China's airplane and put merely China's airplane at the beginning of the video. Very nice and friendly.

Personally, the last time I remember being on a plane was when I was 5 years old (it was my first and last time), which is why I had never really focused on the impact airplanes had on the environment. I assumed they were bad, but never exactly wondered how bad. Before this lecture video I personally thought that even though large sums of CO2 were being emitted by airplanes, it wasn’t as bad because multiple people were being transported at the same time to a common location. It almost seemed as a different way to carpool, but for planes. However, after hearing the lecture it makes much more sense that that’s not the case. I think the most surprising thing was how depending on what type of seat you choose on an airplane it can either increase or decrease your carbon footprint. 
        <br><br>

Apart from the statistics portion of the video, I found Ken’s solutions interesting. Normally, I agree with the solutions and find them to be simple enough for people to easily apply them to their life. However, this time around it was a bit harder for me to accept the solution offered as a viable one. Even though I personally don’t travel, I feel that many people wouldn’t be able to make the switch of taking trains and other methods as much as they could before taking an airplane. The reason is that, apart from time, sometimes train tickets cost more money than taking a plane ride straight to the destination, especially when it’s a trip from California to Europe. This doesn’t allow lower income families to easily choose taking the more environmentally friendly route as opposed to a cheap airplane ticket to their destination.

When I first watched this video, I was amazed that flying only took up 2% of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and was even surpassed by aluminum (2.5%) and cement (5%). But, if one considers how many things are made with aluminum and cement it does make sense that their production may outpace flying, and considering that flights consist of only a small fraction of the population, it is quite damaging. 
        <br><br>

 I was also amazed by the fact that 80% of all flights were made by 1% of people and that flying could double or triple your global climate footprint. I had thought flying was more prolific, though it is obviously preferable that more people do not fly as that would likely be environmentally detrimental. This also made me feel rather guilty as I do intend on travelling in the future and because I work it is difficult to take Professor Ken’s advice and use “slow travel” as my job would likely not give me enough time off. Thus, in the future I will have to plan carefully to avoid contributing to destroying our planet.

This lecture really impacted me because, like many, I have a love for travel. I love everything about travel, from packing, to the airport experience, to exploring and getting lost. However, prior to taking my first class on the climate crisis last summer, I did not know about the environmental effects of air travel. While air travel GHG emissions only account for 2% of total emissions, air travel does have a major impact on an individual’s carbon footprint. Not being able to travel, explore, and learn from discovering new places is one of the things that personally scares me about the climate crisis. There’s so many things about the climate crisis that scare me, and this is one of them. However, as Ken mentioned, there it is still possible to explore and travel without air travel, or at least reducing it. The concept of slow travel is something new to me, and I am excited to learn more about it as it seems like a great way to vacation. However, with this slow travel, there could be some difficulties with having enough time off school or work, and having enough money to travel for longer periods of time. There’s so much more that will go into planning and obstacles to consider, but overall I agree with Ken that slow travel, or traveling to a place for longer periods of time can be an even more rewarding experience that will have a lasting effect on your life.

This lecture made me realize how guilty I am of many of these actions. I personally wouldn't say i am a frequent flyer, but I do fly 1-3 times a year and to actually think that with just one flight alone, I am maxing out on the desired and needed carbon footprint for a better future makes me feel terrible. I have changed my lifestyle in many ways ever since coming to UCSB, I have placed many limitations on my diet including beef and pork, I have stopped driving (who needs a car when you have a bike), and much more. It's pretty crazy how all our actions have a major impact, whether we know it or not, and we have come such a long way that our participation in change isn't just crucial, but mandatory. We all understand that air travel is crucial, but is there any better solutions to international travel besides sea travel (I'm petrified of water), I do what I can, I ride my bike everywhere, when I travel long distance I take the train, but no matter what I do or any of us for the fact of the matter, we are continuously damaging the Earth. It will come to the point where it will be enforced by laws to change, if we dont change by our own terms.

I’ve always known that this would be the hardest thing for me when I became a dedicated environmentalist. I do everything I can to be more sustainable and reduce my carbon emissions, yet flying is the one thing that is very hard for me to give up. I am a traveler at heart and my goal is to see as much of this world as I can and learn about all the different cultures. I probably fly once or twice a year and everytime I do I feel guilty. I would love to participate in slow travel yet as a student I don’t always have the time, and I also travel a lot with my family and it would be hard to convince them to give up the convenience of flying, even though I know convenient does not always mean better. I even would love to purchase an electric bicycle after the car that I own now, but I am worried about the safety of this due to how inefficient the bicycle infrastructure currently is. Even though I am part of the problem, I think that the frequent flyers and owners of private jets are really the ones that need to rethink the way they live their lives. There is no reason to be putting tons of C02 into the air just so you can fly to Paris for lunch and back on a private jet. I also think that reducing the number of products I buy from foreign countries might help as well because then air travel of consumer goods would be reduced. I think that if we can get to a place where air travel is only used when absolutely necessary and the number of planes in the sky per year is drastically reduced, then that would be a good start.

Being someone who doesn't fly frequently, I was very surprised to find out that even a casual or an occasional amount of flying can have such a drastic impact on the environment. I was even more surprised to find out that 80% of all flights are made by just 1% of people in the world. This made me realize that I am actually part of a select few when it comes to having the privilege to fly -- and that I contribute a lot more to the problem of CO2 in the atmosphere than I had originally thought. It scares me that even though some people are living environmentally conscience lives by eating plant-based foods, using public transportation systems, recycling, etc. that they will offset this and more by just going on one flight. It is going to be a necessary challenge to make slow travel -- as Ken brings up -- popular and mainstream.

I too was surprised by the facts in this video. Particularly the idea that 80 percent of all flights are made by just one percent of the population. The other fact that caught my attention was that flying contributes to around 2 and a half percent of green house gas emissions. I find the latter hard to believe. There are so many flights each day, whether it be international or not, and if each flight is so damaging how is it that they only contribute to 2 percent of the damage. I understand that it is the idea that almost all of the population does not fly so it doesn't make much of an impact but 2 percent? Thats just eye opening because this shows how much damage we do to our planet through normal everyday activities like driving and consuming. 
        <br><br>

When I was watching this video I was particularly interested in an idea that Ken previously brought up about the production of cars. I was curious as to see how much CO2 is contributed by just the manufacture of planes alone. If an large car is over 30 tons of CO2 I'm guessing that a plane has to be near 100 tons. 
        <br><br>

Lastly, I liked Ken's introduction to the idea of slow travel. It is sad that we have formed a culture that no longer values adventure. Things today are all about how fast and quick tasks can be preformed and we get lost in the big picture. I find it funny that often people enjoy relaxing at home and watching movies and not doing anything all day but refuse to take a train ride and do practically the same thing.
<br><hr>

I agree with you, I don’t fly frequently but the couple times that I have means that I have contributed a lot, which came as a surprise to me. So the couple times that I’ve flown has added me into the global elite; like you I am part of the privileged people who have the chance of flying. Kens point about being able to hear and see people through smart devices is a good idea. I think the only reason to really travel is when it’s really necessary, like if it’s a family emergency. And, also like Ken said minimizing traveling to one grand vacation every 5 or so years would impact less than traveling more often every 2 years. Taking this alternative would reduce our carbon output much less and it’s so much better because if we really want to vacation to these nice exotic places we need to take care of our planet. If we continue how we’re doing there won’t be anymore exotic places to even visit, so there’s something to think about. 
        <br><br>
Like you also mention, people who are environmentally conscious can be doing all the other carbon reducing methods but if they fly once all that hard work would be for nothing. It is pretty scary to think about because sometimes flying is necessary on occasions, like I previously mentioned, where it’s a literal family emergency.

<br><hr>
I also was surprised to see just how big the effects of flying are compared to other parts of our lifestyle. While other elements of our lifestyle are still extremely detrimental to the earth, this one easily overtakes it all. Like Andrew said, it scares me how taking one flight could offset everything good you've done for the environment. What's even scarier is how mainstream it is to take a flight a short distance, even when it's completely unnecessary. For the breaks, so many of my friends travelled home by plane not knowing the horrible effects of it, but knowing that it was convenient and saved time. The co2 emissions it releases and statistics showing how damaging it is to the environment should be more publicized so travelers can know about the consequences of their actions before the other 98% of the world start using it like we do.
<br><hr>
 I totally agree with your comment that people should really make a commitment to putting slow travel into practice because it is so much more environmentally friendly and enjoyable at the same time. I, too, do not fly frequently and I only flew occasionally for travel, but the fact that I still contributed a significantly large amount of carbon emission and to the climate crisis through those few flying experiences still shocked me a lot. In terms to slow travel, it is emerging to its popularity but is still not as popular as air travel is because it does not get much public exposure or coverage that the majority of society still thinks air travel is really cool and every other means of transportation pales in comparison. The first step for people to start doing slow travel is to raise public awareness on the disastrous environmental impact of flying and the numerous benefits of slow travel. Once people realize the consequences of their decision to take the flight would worsen the environmental situation, then they are more likely to consider alternative means of transportation such as trains.
<br><hr>
Like you, I’m not a frequent flyer at all. In fact, I’ve never even been on a plane. Hearing these facts still shocked me. I didn’t realize that there was double the amount of CO2 being emitted when you fly economy rather than flying first class. I find it interesting how we grow up wanting  to be wealthy and live luxuriously, maybe be able to afford first class or have a private jet. However, doing that results in having a larger carbon footprint. Flying first class results in 6 metric tons of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere. It seems like the higher you move up in wealth and status, the larger your carbon footprint grows. Its sad that to be considered successful, we have to do things that are horrible for the environment. Although I’ve never flown in a plane before, I would want to visit my parent’s home country one day. However, you have to go through some pretty dangerous areas to get there by bus, train, or car. So, I can understand how some places, slow travel might not really be an option for the whole trip there. I like that ken introduced many options, like traveling most of the trip through slow travel or just making small air trips every 5 years. I think that’s do- able. Like Ken said in the lecture, we should  all think about the climate crisis as individuals and make changes in ur own lives. We all can improve in different parts of our lives. Although we might not see the difference were making right away, it might just be enough to help fix the climate crisis, like millions of people around the world are doing.

Wow, Ken really made me question some of my life choices with this one. I had no idea how significant of an impact flying had on the environment until I watched this video. I guess I should have probably realized, but for some reason, transportation has never really felt as significant as it actually is with respect to environmental impacts. There are some things that you see all the time that feel very in your face with how they’re negatively affecting the environment, but there are also a number of other things that we usually never think of that can have as significant, if not a much more significant effect. One example of something I learned recently in this class has to do with the way our houses consume energy. I often feel like I’m good about being environmentally conscious because I do simple things such as turning the water off when I brush my teeth or closing the fridge after a few seconds of it being open. What I often neglect are the even more important expenditures of energy. I often leave the lights on for hours in rooms that I’m not even in, just because it’s a habit and I often forget because I don’t think about it being important. Another good example is with heating and cooling. I’ve sometimes left my windows or even doors open for long periods of time without thinking about whether or not the AC or heater is actively running. These sorts of activities provide a much, much larger impact on an individual’s carbon footprint than whether or not they turn the water off while brushing their teeth.
        <br><br>

Although these examples may be simple, I think it’s important to realize our conceptions of climate change and the different relative effects of different activities might not always be correct. It is important to use statistics, data, and evidence to truly get down to the heart of how humans affect the environment the most. I never would have realized how impactful beef consumption was until I took this class. Now, after a few weeks of looking at everything differently, eating beef seems almost ridiculous to me. Education should always be the first step when it comes to climate change.

After watching this lecture, I was shocked to discover that only 19 out of 20 people have ever stepped foot on an airplane. I also never considered how much of an impact air travel has on a carbon footprint. When Ken mentioned that a round trip from LA to Paris emits about 2 metric tons of CO2, I felt a bit guilty because I recently took a trip from LA to Japan. As someone who loves traveling to new places, this lecture really made me reconsider the amount of travels I will take in the future. As Ken mentioned in the video, I will consider taking one “grand vacation” every few years instead of one normal one every year and also consider more on-land transportation options instead of air travel.
        <br><br>


While it is interesting to know more of the carbon footprint of air travel, this lecture still left me a bit confused about the environmental impact of air travel. I was mainly wondering why first class travel emits so much more CO2 than economy class travel even though they are on the same plane. Another question I had was why air travel emits so much more CO2 than car travel. Is jet fuel much more polluting than gasoline?

Watching this made me feel guilty for the times I have flown. I do drive instead of fly, but usually only when it's convenient and cost-effective. I was surprised to learn the statistic that only 1% of the world has been on a plane, but half of all Americans have also been flying. This proves how different our lifestyles are compared to the rest of the planet. After watching this video I would like to think my habits will change, but I still highly value visiting family, and for me, that means having to fly over the Atlantic. Hopefully, there may be improvements in the future to make flights more carbon friendly. For example, I read in an article that the airline RyanAir may test out a new style of flights less than 3 hours where passengers will be standing as if it was a bus to help increase ridership while bringing down per person carbon emissions.

What appealed to me the most from this lecture was the statement, “life is about the journey and not the destination”. I believe the Slow Travel Movement could contribute much more to our life experience, while also reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Although air travel only contributes to two percent of the greenhouse gases, it was surprising to learn about the CO2 released in a single trip. Flying first class, something we consider “glamorous”, causes a significant amount of harm to our environment. As mentioned in the lectures before, It is the wealthy that contribute the most to the climate crisis. The fact that a single round trip contributes three to six metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere amazes me; it exceeds our expected personal climate footprint.

I live on the 5th floor of FT, where everyday my roommates and I admire the planes that fly from the Santa Barbara airport. Especially at night, dozens of planes come out of this airport: one I honestly didn’t know existed until I came to school here. It made me think of the, honestly, scary amount flights from large airports like LAX. I’m never not shocked while hearing the statistics reflecting climate change. When Ken said that only 1% of our population takes 80% of the world’s flights, I had to rewind and make sure I heard him right. Though I never considered myself as a tremendous contributor to CO2 emissions, I have taken 5 long flights, which puts way more greenhouse gas into the air than most of the people world have. 
        <br><br>

I’ve always dreamed of a life filled with travel: girl trips, honeymoon, spring break, etc. I’ve realized after this video, though, that it’d be way more efficient to dream of a travel, or maybe a few. I never informed myself on how bad air travel was for the environment, so after this video. I definitely want to think about limiting how much I fly in the future. I see how travelling is such an amazing, special luxury now, and how it costs more than just money.

Air travel has long since been an important part of my life. Growing up, I moved around a lot, most of which I moved across oceans internationally. This is a very hard trip to make any other way, as a boat from somewhere like Oahu to Frankfurt is not very practical at all. In this sense, I think that flying is a necessity in the modern day world. A lot of distances are essentially uncrossable in terms of reality. While the idea of a romantic train ride across the country to cut back on carbon emissions and see the landscape is a good one, it often falls short of possibility on account of the terms of most trips. For example, a business trip might have time constraints that require a timely arrival and return. 
        <br><br>

On accounts of business trips and other similar ventures, I can see the appeal of telecommuting. However, once again, the parameters involved in a telecommute are often times not able to line up with the given requirements of a situation. This can be seen in situations like governmental functions where information must be kept private, any job that requires someone to act as a figurehead where physical presence is required, or in a job where the worker is physically needed to help on an operation in a foreign area in a quick fashion. 
        <br><br>

Personal flying, however, is a troublesome thing. There should not be as much of a reason to find yourself flying to a vacation, especially when it’s somewhere that you could drive to, or better yet, bus or train to. This is where I agree with Ken, we need to cut back on personal flying. It is personal flying that we should try and demonize, not airplanes themselves. While someone hopping on an airplane for a vacation or a quick trip is an absolute waste of resources, hopping on a plane to accomplish a specific task that holds value in society might just be a necessity. We should try and change the perspective on flying: flying should be a part of high moving organizations that require the quick, intercoastal transportation of people, not a way to transport people for their own personal means.

After we discussed cars last week, I was very interested in what Ken’s thoughts would be on air travel. Knowing that air travel was very bad for the environment, I was very surprised to find out that only 2.5% of greenhouse gases come from flying. However, I soon realized that although it accounts for a small number of carbon emissions, one flight emits an enormous amount of carbon dioxide.
         <br><br>
Like Ken notes in the video, the fact that only the upper classes of society have access to flying sets a dangerous precedent for the future. If companies were to find a method of making flying more affordable then the amount of air travel would also increase. The small amount of carbon emitted from air travel could increase very quickly, making this small percentage into a very large one. 
        <br><br>
I also enjoyed this video because of the solution that Ken suggests. I feel that he makes a very compelling argument for the slow travel movement with his argument about travel being about “the journey not the destination”. While the concept of slow travel may not be the most time-efficient, I agreed with the premise that the memories you would make along the way would make up for it. His suggestion of taking a train across the country rather than flying sounded very intriguing to me because you would be able to see more along the way, despite taking far longer.

In high school, I flew all the time. Every year, I would go of to my robotics competitions and look for fun, and compete with no idea the bad I was doing for the environment. Did I have to fly? No, but we did since it was easier and gave us more time doing other things.
         <br><br>
Fortunately, now I don't fly nearly as much, but without this class, I wouldn't know not to. This needs o be an issue more informed about as we go into the future, as it is such an easy fix but it is frequently forgotten. This could be an easy way to help reduce carbon footprints and ultimately change our lives for the better, especially if we do as Ken said instead: focus more on the journey than the destination. Why would we forget about something so easily fixable when really it makes us more miserable anyway?

This lecture made me give traveling a bigger emphasis on the journey. I've always been a big fan of finding new ways to do and experience things. and Ken's lecture adds to the idea of adventuring although I don't think I'll be biking up north anytime soon. Although I fly rarely and can't relate to a lot of my classmates I've found it interesting reading how much people travel by plane and how its a central focus for many when they go on vacation. Thanks to my classmates and Ken, I've been given an image of how I can travel while considering my carbon footprint. On the other hand, this lecture makes me consider how taking vacations relate to what we've been learning about in class. My question is how has materialism caused us to use traveling as another escape and thus expand our carbon footprint even more? In my opinion, I think that traveling impulsively comes from our constant need to have something new and finding the next big thing that has developed into our society. Overall, I believe that our carbon footprint in relation to traveling doesn't have to be a burden and can really allow us to become creative with how we go about traveling from electric bikes to train rides.

<p>
The slow travel movement Ken mentioned really resonated with me, as I've done many trips of the same nature on my bike. Traveling by bike is the perfect speed to enjoy the scenery and to get places relatively fast (in comparison to by foot!). Calorie per calorie, it is actually the most efficient form of travel. It won't work for everyone in every case, but it should be seriously considered, which is what the slow travel movement hopes to achieve. I think that's the takeaway here: there are flights we need, and flights we 'need'. Personally, what I've viewed as my flying 'need' is flying from San Jose to Burbank to see my girlfriend long distance (when I'm back in my home town). In times when the day-long drive isn't viable, flights still can be considered carefully. Flying less often can be a matter of planning far ahead, like making the visits longer instead of more frequent, or finding big breaks (like winter break) where the drive or another form of transportation is possible. 

        <br><br>

However, our current travel infrastructure seems to push people towards airplanes and cars over anything else. The long roads that connect countryside to city are built and designed exclusively for cars, not mass transit, bikes, or other traffic. This is terribly inefficient, as it leads to millions traveling alone in cars that will inevitably clog up the roads. So, for any long distance travel, the airplane becomes the preferred mode of travel. With proper investment in bike paths (and adoption of e-bikes), bus lanes, and railways, more efficient forms of travel will become more viable, albeit still slower than air travel. That's why the cultural movement of slow travel is so important as well, since the infrastructure will be for naught if everyone still prefers the fastest mode of travel no matter the case.

Being someone who aspires to travel a great deal in my future, I never knew that so few people actually participated in flying and that it still has such a detrimental impact on the earth. Considering the amount of cities in the United States that have their own airports, it seems natural to believe that most other countries have the same layout. This just displays how our climate situation is worsening with our new generations, as people such as me are being raised in an environment which normalizes luxuries such as flying and doesn’t teach about the bad effects it has (such as using 6 tons of CO2 for every person that flies first class and 3 for those flying coach from LA to Paris. It angers me to keep learning of more and more ways that the successful and wealthy are imposing these destructive disasters on those who have done nothing but simply live their lives. With  the constant modernizing and improvement of technology, our patience has come to an end, due to the option of receiving anything you need to your doorstep the same day. If we could revert to our old ways and slow down the transportation of food, fashion and travel, then maybe we will have a chance of reversing the climate destruction currently occurring on our planet. Even if people chose to fly less, find other ways of traveling or try to avoid trips as a whole by using the internet to complete work instead, it will assist in beginning the fight to restore our atmosphere to what it originally was.

After watching this lecture I realized how much of an impact traveling on airplanes has on our planet. It is devastating to know that only 5% of the population have this privilege and the high amount of airplane travels have contributed 2% of the global green house gas emissions. When i first heard the number I though "oh that not that bad compared to the many others discussed before" but what I forgot to consider was the 5% of the populations part. Yes 2% sounds low compared to the rest but only 5% of the population is causing this. For that small percent of people that is an enormous contribution to greenhouse gases. Unfortunately I'd have to include myself in this 5%. Even though I usually only fly once a year to visit family in Mexico my carbon footprint due to flying is contributing to the crisis as well. Although the alternatives like taking one trip every 5 years, telepresencing, and flying less by reducing your time flight sound relatively easy to follow those alternatives don't quite work for everyone. My family and I try to keep in touch with our loved ones in Mexico already through video calls and we drive to take a bus to Tijuana in order to take our flight there. So in reality we already do 2 of those alternatives. But taking a trip every 5 years would be difficult knowing that my grandparents are old and one of these trips could be the last time my family and I will get to see them. We already limit the trip to once a year so restricting it to any amount of years longer seems quite impossible.

Growing up, I was always asked what my life goals were. Like many of my peers, a top list for me was always travel. In retrospect I should have seen how airplanes could have caused more harm to the environment, but I always thought that like trains, the airplane would be more efficient  and eco-friendly. Obviously, I was very wrong. I was very shocked when Ken explained that while airplanes only account for 2 percent of global emissions, a 24 hour trip could cause nearly three tons of carbon dioxide that go straight into the atmosphere. There are an average of 102,000 flights a day meaning that there is nearly 306,000 tons of carbon dioxide released! That does not include any other carbon emissions released by people daily. I am currently mind blown. I am not a frequent flyer, but I know many people who are so I respected Kens suggestion on finding other ways to travel, even if it is only for a part of the way, to help reduce carbon footprint of flyers. I hope these things are made aware of more to the general public, but like many other things we are learning, our society values fast and efficient. Sadly, we wont put our environment first until it is too late.

Before watching this lecture video, I didn’t even realize how privileged I am to be able to fly in a plane. Only a few people even get to fly in planes as a mode of traveling yet we still emit so much carbon into the atmosphere. I never realized how bad air travel is for the environment. Travel by train should be our first option instead of flying, but it is much more convenient and time efficient to travel by plane. I consider myself a frequent flyer and I enjoy traveling and the ease of traveling by plane, but I think that there should be a better train system to overtake the growing industry of air travel. 
        <br><br>


We can definitely use our technology in a better way in order to be more environmentally friendly. I think that if we find ways to travel without releasing so much gas into the atmosphere it would be ideal.

This film was very eye-opening and I learned a good amount. I knew that flying was bad and that it basically doubles our carbon footprint. But what surprised me was that flying first-class was twice as harmful. You think that being on the same plane would result in the same amount, but if you think about the amount of space wasted compared to the tight economy seating, it makes sense. Everyone wants to say they have flown first class and had a comfortable flight, but not everyone knows how harmful it is. Flying is something that most do not even realize is harmful, they just do it. I think air travel will be extremely to reduce. Many people who are frequent flyers are flying for work which is within a small time frame. Which means taking a train would take too long. Personally, I would love to take a train across the country because I would be able to see many parts that you cannot see from a highway or from above the clouds. 
        <br><br>

I think reducing the amount of flying when possible is an amazing way to make a difference. If able to, take a train or bike. Sometimes it seems like you’re getting your money’s worth when a flight from Kansas takes 3 hours instead of a 28 hour train ride. Comparing a 300 dollar train trip with a 350 air travel ticket seems like an easy decision, spend the extra to get there faster. But in reality, you are costing the earth many times more than your wallet. Why not enjoy all the states in between and see something new. Until air travel is made more sustainable, this is the only viable option if traveling in the states.

This lecture hit me extremely hard. I have moved 15 times in my short 18 years of life. I have taken an uncountable number of planes, almost always cross-continent. Not only have I had to travel by air each of the 15 times I moved, but my family would travel back “home” to California EVERY summer, and every other winter. Furthermore, we would sometimes go on vacation, although we would often take the train or boat when possible. Still, the ridiculous amounts of CO2 that my just my direct family has emitted is breaking my heart. Last year alone, I travelled from Denmark to Cyprus (and back), Denmark to California, California to Japan, Japan to Vietnam (and back), and then Japan back to California. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about all of the CO2 that I emitted in these journeys, far more than my yearly “limit”. 
         <br><br>

Almost all of the people I met at my international schools were in the same boat. Their family would pack up and move to another country (often on another continent) very frequently, usually every 4 years or less. I cannot even fathom the amount of harm that we have caused the environment, and I am so upset at myself for it. There is nothing I can do to take it back, nor was there anything I could do in the past to avoid it (I obviously had no choice in moving with my family). Still, I feel incredibly overwhelmed with guilt and anger at myself. Not to mention, my family still lives abroad, and they still fly back to the US for summer break or winter break. 
         <br><br>

I really liked Ken’s discussion on “slow travel”, and how he highlighted that the journey itself would become the memorable part, not reaching the destination. This reminded me of the time I took a boat from Spain to Morocco, rather than an airplane. While it was an awful trip and everyone was getting seasick, it was far more memorable than if I took a short plane ride. This also made me think back to all the long bus trips I have taken around Europe, usually for sports competitions with my school. Once we took the bus from Copenhagen to Amsterdam, which was an approximately 16-hour long trip. While it took more than 10x longer to get there than it would have by plane, the bus ride was the most fun part of the entire trip. These memories truly support the notion that “slow travel” does not have to be a negative part of travelling, and that it is often the most enjoyable and memorable experience of the trip.
         <br><br>

While I unfortunately cannot change my family’s airplane use, as my dad is still in a job that requires frequent travel, I am glad that I am no longer forced to be part of this and that I can diminish my air travel use once and for all. I have never flown within a country, or even worse, within a state, but I will most definitely never do that in the future. While I know it is impossible to completely cut out air travel from the lives of many, I hope that we can all start being more mindful in our travels. Not only would it be better for the environment, but it would likely cost significantly less, and the experiences that may come from it are unreplaceable.

My family loves traveling, and I usually go on 3 international flights per year, not counting the way back. Just last week, my parents went to visit family and friends in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China, taking a flight between each location and from our home in California. While slow travel has its upsides, there's no real reasonable alternative for international flights when considering time, cost, and convenience. Not all of us can afford to follow Greta Thunberg and travel the world in an environmentally friendly way, and do it without interrupting our busy lives. Not only is air travel by far the best option, there seems to be no upcoming better, environmentally friendly airplane. On the other hand, our efforts to lower our individual carbon footprint will be in vain if each flight emits tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. 
         <br><br>


I was extremely surprised to find out only 5% of people fly, and the 5% who do are dumping a huge amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. I feel very lucky and grateful for the fact that I am of the 5% who has been in a plane, yet at the same time I'm guilty of a huge carbon footprint compared to the vast majority of the world. Going into the future, I will definitely consider slow travel as a means of transportation instead of air travel. However, I think it will be difficult for the rest of my family to adopt these changes. I have family all over the world, and it is common for us to visit each other through flight. While I do not have a solution for intercontinental flights, I believe infrastructure improvements can help. Japan's bullet train is one example that I can see replacing air travel. As long as there is no other alternative, I believe airplanes will continue to be a major factor in the climate crisis.

After looking through this lecture, I realize that my desire to travel is problematic. My sister currently lives in Illinois so the opportunity to see her is very rare. We visit each other about once a year. Learning that traveling by plane emits so much Carbon Dioxide makes this interaction feel so guilty. I feel like despite our efforts to reduce our footprint, my family still ends up on the negative side due to our traveling. 
         <br><br>

The reality that many inhabitants of the earth don't get the luxury of traveling by plane alarmed me at first. I was genuinely surprised. After taking some time to reflect, I realized that this issue is of my own mind and I should be worrying about the environment.



</p><hr>



<p>

The only time I ever got to take a flight was 5 years ago when I came to the US from China. Personally, I have no problem now with flying less or even don’t take flights because I haven’t got into a situation where I couldn’t go somewhere by a bus or car, but I cannot promise this in the future because I would want to travel to places like Japan and Korea where public transportation like trains and buses cannot take me to.
         <br><br>

Reading my classmate’s comments, I believe that most people understand that flying is a big issue in our current climate change crisis since it contributes to a huge amount of greenhouse gas we put in the atmosphere, however, they don’t have a choice. For example, students who don't live in California, especially international students, choose to take flights because it’s the only way they are able to get home. This also applies to people who take business trips, their success depends on it.
         <br><br>

When talking about vacations, longer vacation less frequently would be a good idea. Also, I agree with one of my classmate, Leanne, that personal jets should be banned or at least reduced in a significant amount because they are only benefiting a very small amount of people while contributing to the same amount of pollutants in the atmosphere.

As a young kid growing up, I always wanted to fly. I've always loved traveling and I've always wanted to be in the skies looking down at the earth. After watching this video, my eyes were opened. I've still never flown, and now I probably don't want to. The fact that 80% of all flights are purchased from the top elite is another eye opener. 
         <br><br>

Ken talked a lot about slow travel, and breaking travel into trips. I think this could be equally as fun as a flight. As a matter of fact, its probably a better experience. On a flight, you don't get to see all the places you're visiting. Most people plan on falling asleep. That takes away half of the fun. I never knew just how costly air travel is to our environment.  Hopefully one day when I travel and visit other countries, i'll plan it in a way that takes out air travel. Although im willing to take this route to travel, I still would like to fly one day. But I won't do it at the cost that air travel charges right now. I don't want to pollute the environment that much. Maybe we could make technological advances that would make flying in a plane viable. Electric planes? Renewable energy? I'm not sure. However, I do know that until we make planes that don't pollute the environment so badly, I won't be flying.

I like the specificity of this week’s lecture. I learned to look at the causes of climate change from an individual perspective, not just from a corporation/policy perspective. 2.5% of CO2 emissions from flying. Flying is an even more problematic issue because only 1 percent of the world population is generating all this pollution. 2.5% of CO2 emissions from flying. We have to start thinking about our safety and how much we endanger other people for our own luxurious purposes. With an increasing trend of air travel, we should advocate for the contrary. Flying less is one but I believe using public transportation is key.

<p>
After watching the lecture video, my thoughts about the impact of flying were confirmed. A couple weeks ago I took an ecological footprint test online for one of my classes, and I was left shocked to know that if everyone lived like me it would take 2.2 earths keep the planet sustainable. After getting these results I went back to see how I could change my habits to make my footprint less, and I was shocked to know that cutting down on flying would make a huge difference. I was even more shocked to know that by not flying at all, it would only take 1.2 earths to keep the planet sustainable, including my other habits. 
         <br><br>
I understand that people have to fly sometimes for work, emergencies, etc. however people should make an effort to lessen their flying impact. The ways that Ken mentioned in the video seem like a great start, and I will definitely try my best to utilize them.

I used to go to Mexico for vacation all the time with my family when I was younger. I never even realized the danger that I was causing to my own planet. I feel very bad when looking back at how much of my Carbon Footprint comes from flying. unfortunately there not anything we can do anymore to fix the past but I am now much more aware of the effect flying has on our planet. I wanna take the time to give some appreciation to our own campus and how we are the most bike friendliest campuses in the US. Many people in IV have their cars parked in the same location for many days because they see no need to move their cars. Instead they take bikes or even public transportation. I think when seeing our community and all the good that comes with it, we need to use this as an experience for the whole world.

One of the things I’ve found interesting in this video is the slow travel movement that is starting to pick up some steam. I find it fascinating that a “slow” movement could be gaining popularity in this day and age. I feel like everything in society has shifted towards being fast. We have new shows every week, fast fashion, fast food, fast travel, fast everything. We have been consumed by immediate gratification. I live about a 4 minute walking distance from my mailbox yet my family always insists on driving their to our mail. Not only is that environmental bad but to it really just points out our growing impatience as a people. We want to binge and consume as much as possible and it isn’t sustainable if everyone in the world lived liked this. Slow travel I find cool because it emphasizes the journey of the trip and not the time it takes. I wouldn’t mind traveling up the coast to get to San Francisco on an electric bike. Yet many would scoff at this idea. We need to change the view things in our society because the way we live to today can’t last forever and is doing immense damage to the planet.

Some of my fondest memories are of my dad, sister, and me riding the bus around LA for a day. It was such an adventure visiting all of the different locations. It was only later that I found out my Dad planned this as a way to still get out but for cheap. 12 years later, I drive on the daily. I fly about twice a year. Yet, I still believed I had a relatively small carbon footprint. Well, after watching Ken’s video and reading the article, I was quite wrong. I’ve already exceeded my allotted 2 metric tons from flying alone. 
         <br><br>


It is time for people to reduce their flying. Easier said than done though. I think about all the places I want to travel to. I think about the times where I have no choice because it is a family trip and it is to be expected that I go. I don’t think a transition to people flying less will be easy. For business people, I suggest telepresencing themselves. For those who like to travel, if you have the time… perhaps slow travel. Another option would be to take public transit to the airport. Then, at your destination stay there as long as possible and visit as much as you can in one trip. 

         <br><br>

One might suggest raising the prices of flights but that would not only encourage the gap between rich and poor, it would also suggest that flying is still ok. What might be the most useful is to start teaching young kids that flying is not ideal. Cities could also start designing mass public transit and better bike lanes to encourage a more environmentally friendly way of transportation.

This lecture made me feel very guilty about my flying habits, but there are simply some things that can’t realistically be cut out. All of my family lives in Europe and I definitely wouldn’t be willing to stop travelling there every few years to see them. What I could do, however, and what I’ve done in the past, is take a train from England to France, and from Paris to Marseille. What I don’t think I could do however, is sacrifice however long it takes to take a train across the US to reduce some of the impacts. That is too time consuming. The idea of slow traveling is lovely but simply isn’t attainable for many. The point of air travel is that it is quick. Most people don’t have the time to take 4 days to bike up the coast from Santa Barbara to San Francisco when a car or a plane would get them there in a significantly shorter amount of time.
         <br><br>
All of that being said, I completely understand where Ken is coming from. We can’t sustain this way of traveling if we want to solve this crisis. Although I think some things can have exceptions, for the most part, air travel can definitely be reduced. When it comes to businessmen who literally fly places for a single day, Facetime or Skype can so easily be used instead. When it comes to vacations, they can be taken less frequently. I am also blown away by the numbers Ken presented us with throughout the lecture. It saddens me and makes me feel very guilty that 19 out of 20 people have never set foot in a plane, yet air travel still accounts for a portion of greenhouse gases. I used to think I wasn’t a frequent flyer, as I only traveled once a year, if that, but I am now realizing that even that takes such a toll on the environment. It saddens me because I love traveling and exploring new places, but the crisis is so much bigger than that. It just sucks that it has come to this. One question I have is why does flying first class release twice the amount of flying coach?

Yeah, as someone who rarely gets to travel, I've come to realize just how expensive it truly is. My family usually opts to drive but in reality, flying would have cut the cost. Slow travel does seem romantic, but realistically the cost would be too great. You would have to constantly buy food and find a place to stay the night. Traveling is honestly a luxury that few can afford, so when people get the chance to they usually want the least expensive option. Air travel has become a lot cheaper now so I think trying to convince people to travel slower while paying more is gonna prove easier said than done. My family has also recently gotten their papers so now they plan to frequently visit Mexico but their hometowns are pretty far so flying just seems like the better and more practical option. I know flying is basically a vehicle of greenhouse gases, but as Ken said, the majority of people spend their whole lives without ever setting foot in an airplane. People who do get to travel every once in a while to visit family, as you said, shouldn't have to feel guilty. Sometimes flying is the only reasonable option and its only for a special occasion. Flying does need to be addressed because it is a problem, but I don't think it is one that concerns the middle or lower class. In reality, the people who are the biggest problem are the rich who excessively use it as a means of travel. Business-related deals don't have to be made in person, they're strictly business-related so it can easily be done over the phone. I get that celebrities need to fly privately for their safety and to avoid attention, but private jets are so unnecessary to me. Most of the times celebrities just "flex" their private jet by using them for short distances.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. A majority of my family lives in India, and my family and I make it a point to visit every 2-3 years if we are able to. I think the flying less is a great thing to keep in mind, and when I am able to live a more independent life, I will seriously considering breaking down longer trips. If I suggest this to my parents now, they will argue and say "why are you putting your body through so much discomfort, exhaustion, and stress when you could just take a simple flight that will get you where you need to be fast?" They have a point. The reason such large aircrafts exist in the first place is they want to be able to transport as many people as possible to maximize efficiency. I think that's the best we can do in this current moment. I think flying less for the average person is certainly doable and is something I can try to consider, as I fly domestically maybe 1-2 times a year, and internationally, every 2-3 years. 
<br><Br>

I think the key to a lot of the issues we are studying with climate change come from removing life's "go go go" attitude and taking things slower. For example, we see fast fashion and fast travel as two ways we don't want to waste time. I think the slow food and slow travel movement are really important and creative ideas to combat this, because they emphasize that it's important to take time to accomplish anything. I also had the same question as Ella, why does flying first class emit more carbon as flying in economy or basic economy?



<br><hr>

I felt exactly the same way after watching Ken’s lecture video. Yes, I definitely feel guilty for having the privilege of traveling by plane to multiple countries in the past 19 years of my life, but the rest of my family lives in Taiwan and Germany. It already takes a grueling motion-sick-filled 12+ hours in a plane to travel there, and I can’t imagine having to travel even longer by train or bus.
<br><Br>


As you said, it’s way too time-consuming. But again, as you said, I get what Ken is trying to tell us. I think he had some good ideas, such as choosing to wait for one grand vacation every couple of years instead of having several small ones multiple times in one year. And I think that if more people made the effort to reduce their individual air travel and turn to traveling by bus or train when possible, the carbon footprint air travel leaves would still be reduced by a significant amount. But it would also greatly benefit us if the U.S. would be more active in providing more public transportation like in Taiwan, where they have bullet trains and subways, or Germany, where they have high-speed trains as well as a stronger bus system and safer bike paths. It's a major obstacle in trying to travel more environmentally considerate.

<br><Br>

But I do completely understand Ken’s message. I’d love to travel in the future, but I realize that exploring new places doesn’t necessarily mean I have to get there quickly by plane. I can find alternative ways to travel, like by train or maybe even by electric bike as he suggests, and in the end, I could find myself having a much more rewarding and memorable experience than if I took an airplane.


<br><hr>
I can definitely see why this recommendation might not apply to everyone, namely people in your situation. One where air travel is the only method of seeing family. However, I can definitively say people in my situation can certainly cut down on their air travel. Many of my best memories growing up were of traveling with my family. It is hard to say if I could've had any equally enjoyable childhood without traveling so frequently, but I genuinely believe that doing it so frequently was unnecessary. I likely traveled out of the country around twice per year when I was younger and I think that easily could've been cut down to like once per 3 years without any major consequence. However, unlike rampant consumerism, where there is no value in taking part in it, traveling truly is one of the most deeply enjoyable things one can do. To possibly remedy this issue, I think a great alternative is to try living in a different country for a year or so. Studying abroad, for example, although it requires taking a plane, you are only taking two planes in order to literally live in a foreign country for months and at the same cost as studying here at UCSB. I think this option is an even better alternative to taking "vacations" in various countries. The true beauty in a foreign country is not going to the top of the Eiffel tower or going on the London eye, the uniqueness is immersing yourself in the culture and that's not something that a brief 1-week vacation can provide. This comment, once again, is purely targeted at those who travel frequently and for non-familial reasons. But for those in this situation, I would highly recommend living or studying abroad as it will provide much more value than any vacation and reduces the economic and environmental cost.

I totally understand where you’re coming from. Nearly 90% of my extended family lives in Hawaii; from my hometime, the trip constitutes a six hour plane ride there and a six hour plane ride back. My family and I have typically done this trip once or twice a year for the past nine years, and I’m sure it’s a habit that will continue into the future. We value our family on the islands a lot, but after Ken revealed how drastic the impact of flying is on the planet, I’m questioning if we really need to travel there as often as we do. I have two parents and three siblings, meaning there’s six of us total who are increasing our individual carbon footprint. If a 24-hour flight from LA to Paris contributes 3 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then two round-trip flights to Hawaii produces the same. While we do at least not fly first class, we’re still contributing our fair share to the crisis. 

<br><Br>

 My family does a lot of traveling outside of just these trips to Hawaii as well. I’ve had the opportunities to travel to Haiti, Saint Martin, and more while my parents have additionally gotten to travel to Australia, Cabo, Bora Bora, Fiji, and so many more places. These experiences have created memories that my family will remember for a life.; my younger siblings have already gotten to be enriched in so many cultures while growing up, and all three of them aren’t even 10-years-old yet. While I’m so glad they’ve gotten to experience these things, I can definitely admit that their lives would still be as good if they hadn’t experienced them. Traveling is a great thing, but it’s not a critically essential part of development. Time could instead be better spent educating children about how to make sustainable life choices, as well as spacing out vacations in a way that demonstrates how being able to travel is a privilege.

<br><hr>


I travel quite often because I believe that experiencing other cultures is necessary for education. I traveled across Central America and in Europe by train which was very easy, yet time consuming. I feel guilty for contributing to such an output of CO2 but I try to do what I can aside from air travel. Instead of driving across the state to visit my family, I call them. But the batteries in cell phones which are made of lithium are bad for the environment. This is just so discouraging for me because I can't seem to find an answer to achieve a balance of good and bad. I want to do what I can but with new statistics and long-term effects being shown, how do we completely change the way our cultures are wired. With a 50% increase in air travel in China, I think it would be best to understand why this occurred and find ways to decrease it again. We could also make train and ship travel more common, or even public transportation more acceptable.

I have been in an airplane 6 times in my life. I never really thought about how much this affects the environment. I knew that this has an impact but I never thought about it until I got to this class. Being in this class makes me analyze the decisions I make in my life. I am from the Central Valley and since beginning here at UCSB, I realized that instead of having my parents come pick me up, I could take the train home. This has become an easier way for me to get home and I have come to realize in this class that it is better for the environment. I never really thought about riding a train until moving away from home. I just thought it would be a fun way of traveling and I have come to enjoy it.

I find it very difficult to imagine a life where I have to restrict myself to life without planes. The biggest issue for me is not being able to traveling domestically, it is being able travel to see my extended family in India. Traveling domestically, the train ride itself would be an adventure, but internationally when trying to see family. it would be hard to spend half the allotted vacation time trying to reach them. Not to mention, it can also be far more expensive to travel by ship. Still if we are to transition back to a more sustainable environment and protect such an environment, everyone is going to have to make sacrifices and changes to their ways of life. A bigger challenge than me specifically choosing to take less carbon intensive albeit slower methods of transportation is convincing my parents and other family to do the same. While my parents do believe in climate change they also have a mentality where they believe they do not have to do anything because it will not make that big of a difference. They also believe we should focus more on the pollution of the corporations when the truth is these corporations are polluting because of the services they provide the public with and profit off of us with.

This title of this video broke my heart because I really, truly love to travel. I’m not even sure if it’s something I would be able to give up even knowing how horrible of a carbon footprint it has. I think traveling is an incredibly important educational experience, but how are we supposed to decide if that is more important than reducing carbon emissions? However, I think Ken is completely reasonable in encouraging us to use other modes of transportation when possible and suggesting that we take one major trip every few years rather than one or two each year. I was so surprised to hear that the emissions from a round trip flight from LA to London were equivalent to 1.5 years of the “ideal” level of carbon emissions. I don’t even know how to wrap my head around that. A flight like that seems so “normal” yet emits a year and a half’s worth of emissions?! Also, 2.5% of total emissions is extremely significant considering that 19/20 people have not ever stepped foot on a plane. It’s crazy to think that if everyone could travel we would nearly double our annual emissions. However, improvements in technology (being able to easily make long distance calls, FaceTime, etc.) gives me hope that not as many people will have to travel as frequently for work. And if the rest of us limit how many times we fly on a plane for leisure trips, then we can truly reduce our carbon footprint from flying. Even if we are able to cut the amount of flying in half, that could be up to 1.25% reduction in carbon emissions - and although that may not seem like much, it is a clear step forward.

Like many of the videos we have watched in this class so far, this one makes me feel awful for the part I have taken in contributing to the climate crisis in this way. Flying in particular is one thing that I knew was bad for the environment, but I had no idea just how much CO2 is contributed in one trip, especially when faced with the staggering 6 tons emitted if flying in first class. Another thing I was relatively ignorant to is the classism involved in flying, most likely because of how normal flying has been to me my whole life. My mom is always traveling across the country for work, and while I hated flying because of the safety risk, I now have a whole new reason for it. Knowing that traveling by train is so much better is encouraging me to take the train to go home more often rather than my car or, god forbid, a plane.

After watching this video I have learned that I am finally apart of the social elite as i have flown more than 3 times in my life. Ive also leaned that I am 1 in 20 people that have flown on an airplane and that it produces around 3.5 metric tons of CO2. Does this mean that I will stop flying, the short answer is, no. I believe that flying is one of the most convenient ways to travel in terms of time. Also If I were to stop my flying altogether I would feel as if Ive really done nothing to change the environment. In fact what's never been addressed is the US military's flying habits as well as their production of millions of battleships, cruisers, helicopters, planes, etc...  I think that in the day and age that we live in it would be vigorously impossible to cut out all flights in the world because that would mean every nations military would collapse. We need to also hold our government accountable for what they contribute to the climate crisis.  But in terms of my personal flight use I would say that my best option is to limit the amount of times I Fly. That is easy enough for me but my 3.5 megatons hasn't made up for the amount of CO2 that is being released as we speak.  Hopefully there is some way to make planes better for the environment or some other mode of transportation which is just as effective but until that time comes, in my opinion, planes are just too valuable to the world to see any change.

After listening to Hiltner’s lecture, it made left me surprised and have a new sense of respect for our planet. I was surprised to hear that 19/20 people have not flown on a plane before, I did not expect it to be so high but I had a feeling it would be. I have been to Canada many times and traveled to Europe via plane as well. See finally understand how much damage planes do to our planet makes me want to tries new ways to get to places and appreciate the trip along the way. I quite enjoy the train because of how much I got around in Europe with it, and it makes me want to try to get to new places that are far away on it. It was good of Hiltner to provide alternatives to flying and to give others hope to get around safely for our planet. I never considered myself rich either, but with only 5% of the world ever flying, it makes me realize how privileged and lucky I am. Am I actually lucky to have been able to fly? Or is it a burden knowing that I have done it and caused so much damage to our planet?

This lecture video made me feel like any environmentally conscious effort I made or will make is futile since I am a flyer. I recently traveled to Nigeria over winter break and was in the air for over 50 nearly 60 hours. I flew from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. to Ethiopia to Nigeria, and returning I flew from Nigeria to Ethiopia to Ireland to Washington D.C. to Los Angeles. I had to fly out of my way since I flew through Ethiopian Airlines, but regardless the flight would have been extensively long. I am not a fan of flying since I am 6'3 and have to sit in economy or business seats which aren't very accommodating. But, if I want to see my family in Nigeria, I do not know any means of getting there besides airplane travel. While Ken articulates that the slow travel would be a great experience, being able to go to my homeland and connect with family I would not otherwise see is a better, even once in a lifetime experience. I've been there only about 4 or 5 times if my memory serves me correctly,  but based on these numbers I'd already have been a premier propagator of the climate crisis. Though I have my car at UCSB, I typically only drive it on the weekends or if I'm going back home, but besides that I use public transportation or my legs. But since I have spent so much time in the air, does this even alleviate my carbon footprint? Regarding the statistic about 80% of flights being made by 1% of the world's population... I just feel like this is incorrect. If you take into account the myriad celebrities and wealthy individuals who use private jets or helicopter travel, these numbers just do not add up; and does this take into account the people who are not frequent flyers, but I have only flown a select amount of times when no other form of transportation seemed plausible? I could be wrong, but that seems very extreme. Furthermore, I saw another student's comment regarding the variance between gasoline and kerosene (jet fuel). Is this discrepancy of emissions solely stemming from the intrinsic difference in the compounds, or is it a result of the way they are used by their respective vehicles (typical car engine vs. jet turbines)? I'm sure it's more to do with the latter, but these numbers seem very extreme as well.....

<br><Br>

I know that there is always something that one can do to help the environment and reduce their carbon footprint, but does flying simply negate that? Statistically speaking, me recycling everything that I can or leading a minimalist lifestyle is incomparable to the drawbacks of air travel.

Since coming to college, I have definitely become a frequent flyer. I've gone home many times in these first two quarters, two of the times has been by flying. I had two options, either go by car which takes about 6 hours or fly, which takes about 1. I chose flying a few times because I didn't want to go through the hassle of finding a rideshare. In total, it took around the same amount of time being in the airport and boarding, but with flying I didn't get to enjoy the California coast as much as I normally do whilst driving home. Being one of the top 1% in the world who does fly doesn't surprise me that much, being that we live in the highly privileged US. What did surprise me however was the sheer amount of CO2 emissions it produces on flights, even though my flight wasn't from LA to Paris, it still produced a hell of a lot more CO2 than by driving. I actually looked up a CO2 calculator and my just one hour journey produced about 236.8 pounds of carbon dioxide. I'm definitely going to think twice about flying from now on when I go home to visit. Not only does it not even take less of an amount of time for me, I also don't get to enjoy the beautiful coast along the way. Just as Ken said, it's about the journey, not the destination.

Before taking this class, flying and it’s relation to climate change had never crossed my mind. I knew cars were detrimental to the environment, but the fact that airplanes and jets produce so much CO2 was not something I was actively aware of or thinking about. After learning this, I will now reconsider taking a flight next time I travel and as Ken said, you can make traveling much more of a memorable experience with slow travel by either taking the train or riding your bike. I think this also relates to last week’s reading of Walden by Thoreau in that we should live simply. By traveling by train you can create a simple travel experience by not having to go through the stressful process of TSA and airport traffic; rather you can sit back and relax on a beautiful seaside train. 
<br><Br>

The fact that traveling first-class doubles your carbon footprint was very astonishing, yet our society makes it seem so luxurious. It is our duty as a society to change the culture around travel and see the destruction that it is causing. 
<br><Br>

Once again, the largest contributors to the climate crisis are those who are privileged and carelessly buy into something that may not seem destructive to the environment at its surface level. Our society makes a luxurious, expensive lifestyle seem so appealing, yet it is this lifestyle that causes so much harm to our environment.

After watching the video, I was surprised by how much air travel accounts for greenhouse gas emissions. The simple actions that we rarely notice are harming or planet such as the production of cement. The saddening fact is that one percent of the people on the planet are responsible for pollution due to air travel. The shocking part is that people traveling by air participate in the emission of hazardous gasses without their knowledge. With the realization that frequent air travel by individuals could be tripling their carbon emissions footprint, I feel that people should reduce the number of times they travel by air. I think people can minimize air travel by only traveling when they have to or by resulting to other forms of transport.
<br><Br>

       I feel that people owe it to themselves to reduce harmful emissions. Technology such as Skype and telephone calls can help mitigate the climate crisis by reducing the need to travel since people can connect via these technologies as opposed to traveling. I feel that people should embrace other alternatives to air travel. A good alternative would be to travel by train. Although the alternatives may be slower, I think that they are the way to go attributing to the fact that the environment is at stake.

This video was an eyeopener as I never realized how much of an impact flying has on our planet. When you said that air travel in China had increased by 50% in 5 years, this also made me think of how fast the rest of the world is modernizing, and more people from all countries will start to fly more. This is definitely worrisome, just like how there will be an increasingly large amount of cars on the planet as we start modernizing in the world (as if there already isn't enough). Sadly, just like how cars are a luxury and a sign of success, flying/traveling has been greatly romanticized and seen as a dream goal as well. Although I do understand that everyone wants to visit other countries for the experience and they should be allowed to, I think we all need to be more conscious of how millions of others have the same plans as us, and we should search for the most environmentally friendly way to get to our destination (like the New York to Europe example). With this information, I relay this to my friends and family if they ever want to go on a trip, and help them plan a better way that will be equally exciting to reach their destination.

I live in Los Angeles and over the summer I visited one of my closest friends in San Francisco. It was an 8-hour bus ride and the only reason I took it was that I had the time and it was very last minute. Being on the road for that amount of time, I do agree with Ken that it was a nice experience. I was finally able to listen to this 4-hour playlist I had been working on and was able to enjoy the scenery around me. Though, the idea of flying definitely crossed my mind for the trip back. Despite it being a cool experience, the idea of sitting on a bus for another 8 hours was very unappealing. While I had the option to avoid air travel, I can see why people might choose this method of transportation.  Some people may not even have a choice. While flying is very bad for the environment, it's faster and convenient. My roommate is from new york, my close friend is from Canada and whenever they have to plan their flights, their schedules are already so packed. I couldn't imagine them driving there just because of the amount of time that would take. 
<br><Br>
It's unfortunate how more convenient flying is because it is so bad for the environment. Before watching this video, I never considered how bad it actually was. To learn that it contributes about 2.5 tons of carbon just for one trip was shocking. While I do not fly often, it's disheartening to know that when I do, I will have contributed more than the average person to carbon emissions in one flight.

I actually have only flown once ever in my lifetime and it was recently only to LAX for a concert. It was a weird experience being 23 years old and not having gone on a plane however the real issue here is planes that are actually EMPTY with few people. Do not even get me started about people and their private jets. Of course people like celebrities are looked up to even though they fly their private jets everywhere and have left a carbon footprint equal to more than thousands of people. When you see these people come out of jets do you applaud them and look up to them? Well i don't, I scorn them for not only being privileged but by the way they go about flying from place to place like its nothing. I do not feel responsible for this issue since I have only been on one flight ever in my life, however I know I probably will fly in the future but will try my best to always fly less.

While I haven’t flown very much in my life, I can clearly see why it is one of the worst things we can do to the environment. Flying is so ingrained in our American way of life, so it seems difficult to combat traveling this way unless we raise ticket prices (which would probably cause mass upset for people), develop some new clean technology for flying, or come up with faster and cheaper clean methods of travel like trains. I thought it was pretty crazy that flying coach from LA to Paris cost 3 tons of carbon, and 6 times more if you flew first class. I am still unsure as to why the first class is so much worse. Is it because there are less seats there, so fewer people can travel on that plane as opposed to having the same amount of seating for everyone? Is it the amenities that come with it? If anybody knows I would appreciate some more insight on it. It is also unbelievable to think that 19 out of 20 people haven’t flown. We think it is such a common occurrence because of how much people in America travel, and how much they value being able to travel by plane since it’s so much faster than the alternatives. I see planes land and take off from the airport here basically non-stop, and this isn’t even a big airport compared to others like LAX or JFK. But when you look at flying in the context of the rest of the world, and how many people live in developing countries that cannot afford to fly, or just have no need to, then I can start to understand why it is such a luxury. Should I have the desire to fly somewhere in the future, or just absolutely need to for some reason, I will be mindful of my impact on the environment, and try to limit my emissions as much as possible. Taking an alternative such as a train, even to travel part of the distance, seems very doable, and seems enjoyable and less stressful than flying.

Prior to this video, I didn't realize how privileged I am to be able to fly. It seemed like a norm for my family and friends. Because of this, I was pretty astonished when I heard that 19 out of 20 people never set foot on a plane. I know that flying is bad and if given the opportunity to take a luxury train across the country to visit my family I would but my parents simply do not receive enough vacation time to make this a reality. I definitely agree that lifes about the journey and not the destination but my parents' work schedule just prevents this. Thus, a massive cultural shift in the united states would have to take place where companies start giving more vacation time to allot for different traveling methods. I doubt this will happen though because plane emissions only account for 2 percent of the global CO2 emissions.

I honestly was so surprised when I found out that “air travel only accounts for about 2%, maybe 2.5%, of total greenhouse gas emissions globally.” I expected that number to be higher. But it makes sense when Professor Ken explained that “19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot in an airplane.” Although I expected the number to be higher, I am guilty of negatively impacting the environment. However, there are a couple times as a student at UCSB when I opted to fly from Santa Barbara to Sacramento (my hometown) simply because it was more convenient for me than carpooling/finding a rideshare on Facebook. I felt shame throughout watching the lecture and learning how much I contributed to the climate crisis even though I did not initially know how detrimental flying was to the environment. I did not think too much about my transportation in regards to the climate crisis because I mostly bike or walk on a daily basis to get to places given the nature of this college campus. However, this lecture proved me to be naive and ignorant. This lecture also made me realize how privileged I am for solely having the opportunity for flying from one place to another, especially since “80% of flights are made by just one percent of all people on the planet.” I agree that we should not view flying as a glamorous mode of transportation and should consider slow travel movement. I will now be more conscientious regarding how I travel both short and long distances.

I like to travel and traveling with my family during breaks is of the only time we all spend together now because my brothers and I are in college now. I believe there is much to gain from traveling and the cultural knowledge you gain is not comparable to simply learning about a place or culture. The fact how a single flight can account for double one's suggested annual carbon output is a mind blowing fact and is very discouraging. Though I agree that when possible trains and slow travel can be just as enjoyable, but when going to Taiwan to visit family or other places that are far, it just does not seem practical. I live in state so I do not need to fly to get home but for my friends who live in Greece or Kansas I do not think it is reasonable to ask them to not fly to go home. Also my mom has to fly sometimes for business trips and that is just something she has to do. I still do see that flying has a major impact on the environment but I just do not personally see a way to solve that for people who want to travel somewhere far, live far, or need to for work.

Before this video, I had never really thought about the slow travel movement. I think that this movement is good, however I believe that it is something that will only be effective in some situations. Airlines and big companies will only change their ways if they experience a large decrease in the demand of flights, so I think it might be difficult to actually make a difference since already a small percentage of the population utilizes air travel. I think that it would greatly impact the environment’s carbon footprint if we could find a more sustainable and less polluting option that is just as efficient as air travel. Even though airplanes emit 2% of total greenhouse gases, the more that we can reduce air travel, the more we reduce the carbon footprint on the planet. One way to reduce air travel would be through improvement of the rail system. If trains were more efficient and reached a more extensive amount of places, people would probably choose them over airplanes. These trains could be a less expensive option for those who are traveling short distances, or within a continent. Over the summer, I went on a trip around Europe with some of my fellow graduates from my high school. We flew to Norway and the United Kingdom, but for the rest of the trip, we took a bus to the other countries. Although flying would have been more efficient, traveling by bus was a more affordable option and also reduced our carbon footprint. After watching this video, I felt guilty because during a duration of a month, my carbon footprint had exceeded my CO2 emission allotment for the year, by a lot.

<p>

As I watched this lecture video, I was honestly really shocked to see that flying is literally one of the worst things you could do to the environment. It really never crossed my mind that planes definitely emit a lot more CO2 than other forms of transportation, but that fact that they are capable of doing that much damage, and yet are a regular things used by people blows my mind. It's also really upsetting because I would love to travel a bunch in the future but after watching this video it really made me question how I can achieve that goal without impacting the planet in a negative way.


</p><hr>



<p>

All this video made me think about was my parents. For as long as I can remember, my parents have listed their biggest life goal to be to "travel the world". Every summer since I was born I remember flying to somewhere different and exotic in the world, accompanying my parents on their desire to see the world. This video broke my rose-tinted glasses on the beauty of travel: had I known that every trip I ever made had a measurable negative impact on the environment, maybe I wouldn't have felt so carefree about getting away from my home for a bit and exploring another country. I've flown so much in my life, and I'm seeing now how unimportant it all was in the face of the problem of saving the climate. People will say that travelling the world and seeing the sights is a necessity, and that taking that away in the name of saving the planet is wrong, but there can be travel if there is no planet to explore. Climate preservation takes precedent over travel, no matter how much value there is to be found in seeing the world.

Before watching Ken’s lecture, I was not aware of the huge footprint of air travel. This lecture also provides a variety of possible ways to reduce the footprint caused by air travel, while I found those solutions interesting and referenceable, I also think some of them might not be so practical in some cases. For example, for the travel from LA to Paris, if one has a specific goal or business to do at the destination, change from train to flight in the middle at New York City might be relatively inconvenient and costly. However, if one is only to travel, then the change might be not only worthwhile but also interesting. Hence, I think these solutions will also apply according to different realistic situations. 
 <br><Br>

I also found Ken’s notion of “slow travel” interesting, which is related to “slow food”. In the age in which most people are pursuing efficiency, it is often hard to be slow. For me, I may not prefer slow travel, especially for that of a very long distance. However, I might not take a flight just solely for travel. Instead, whenever I need to do some studies or work in a place that I haven’t been to, I would like to see that as an opportunity of traveling. I remember years ago I saw a sentence saying that traveling is basically visiting the daily life of people in another area. 
 <br><Br>

Finally, I strongly agree with Ken’s promotion of telecommunications. I personally experienced the effectiveness of telecommunications. I used to have some classes online as my teacher and me are far away from each other, and I felt that it is very effective in terms of study efficiency, and certainly, it saves a lot of time and is better for the environment.

As I watched this video, I naturally felt good about myself as I’ve never considered myself to be a frequent flyer. However, I must admit that this is not by choice. With a mom that’s afraid of heights, my family and I hardly ever fly. The few trips I have taken by plane, have either been by myself or with friends, which have only happened a couple times throughout my life. Because of how rarely I’ve traveled, I made it my life’s goal a while ago to travel as much as I possibly can in the future. For these reasons, I was really disappointed to hear about all of the damage flying does to our planet. There are other means of travel that Ken brought up, but honestly, to me they just really aren’t the same. There’s something that fascinates me about being up in the air. It could be the views, or just the simple fact that it’s such a rare thing I get to do. No matter the reason, I must admit that I’ve always seen flying as the most ideal mode of transportation when going long distances. However, if I were to become a frequent flyer in the future, the amount of damage I would be doing to the planet is something I don’t even want to comprehend. So yes, the information this video brought up on flying was quite disappointing, however, I appreciate Ken for bringing it to light, as I probably would have never reconsidered this life goal of mine without being aware of all of it.

I found this lecture video to be one of the most impactful because it squarely calls me out. Despite any efforts I have made to reduce my carbon footprint I find that they are all overwhelmed by the fact that i fly frequently. As much as I would like to reduce how much I fly, I have a greater desire to see my family and friends when we are released from break and since I am from Texas, flying has become the most convenient way of travel for me. I struggle to reconcile however how I can be considered such an advocate for the environment when I myself am guilty of giving into the convenience of air travel.
 <br><Br>


Just recently I suggested to my mom how I would be opened to taking the train home but she just scoffed pointing out the amount of time I would loose (almost 2 days of travel) just to get home. While I strongly support slow travel, its difficult to carry out in the context of limited time and convenience. With a limited amount of time, slow travel just isn't practical for many people. Overall, I hope to limit the amount of times I fly home in the next years and am now more aware of how much flying adds to my carbon footprint.

I definitely had a moment of realization after watching this video lecture. I am not completely sure what constitutes as a frequent flyer, but given the fact that 99% of the world has never ridden in an airplane, I may be guilty. And to think that one trip can double the damage of my entire life makes me sick to my stomach. This may be one of the hardest things to come to terms with when dealing with my carbon footprint since there are locations people simply cannot get to without flying. I have had to fly on extremely short notice for family emergencies to get there in a matter of hours. There was no way that I could have been thinking of my carbon footprint at that time. How could I? There were clearly more important things to tend to. That is what is so hard about being a conscious decision maker 24/7 when it comes to your impact on the climate decline. How is it humanly possible to have that thought in the back of your head during every second of the day for every scenario you encounter? It frustrates me a bit because I blame people for not being conscious of it, but look at me! I am just as guilty as everyone else. I cannot point fingers. I will say that since I have started at UCSB, I have biked, bused, and trained everywhere. This shift away from automobiles makes me feel a bit better for all of the damage I have done by flying.

My family and I both love traveling. In the past, I visited lots of places crossed country or city only by airplane, but I didn’t even think about how much impact it would bring to our planet. I was so naive to believe that air traveling is like taking public transportation, and the amount of pollution will be divided by each person as the buses and subways. However, the truth is our climate crisis contributed by air travel is much rapidly and harmful.
 <br><Br>

As an international student, I can only choose air travel when the winter/summer break to go back home. The round-trip flight is around 24 hours, which makes me at least 6 tons of carbon dioxide per year. After watching this video, I am eager to find a solution to students traveling because there is a large international student body in the US who has a similar condition as me.
 <br><Br>

In the past, I rarely take a train to travel. After Ken’s recommendation, I think it would be interesting if I plan a trip that goes around the country only by taking a train or biking. However, I’m not sure I can by only taking the train to travel between school and my home, so I hope the government can build a railroad in the future.

This week’s lecture video brought me many new ideas. What I need to consider is the harm of transportation to our environment. I travel by air almost every year, and I don't think the availability and supportability of transportation are inconsistent. Every time I fly back to the United States, I am grateful for this kind of transportation. Between innovation, development, and nature. All we can do is limit our access to airplanes or other expensive means of transportation. Given the damage I do to the earth by flying, I do feel very sad. There are so many ways to travel. Soon, when I saw how many miles I'd accumulated by flying, I was never satisfied because I was getting more discounts for the next short trip, but only because I was leaving a huge carbon footprint for destroying nature.

Prior to watching this lecture video, I had already known that environmentally, the worst thing you can do is fly. What I didn’t know was that air travel only accounted for approximately 2-2.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. As soon as I heard that it only accounted for such a small percent, I immediately thought, “This can’t be true. That has to be a mistake. Why is it so low?” I had always assumed that the percentage would be much higher because the idea of traveling by airplane was normal for me. How else would you get to places on the other side of the world? Then I realized, not everyone has the luxury or finances available to be able to fly places. It did not occur to me that so many people have never set foot on an airplane before. I was shocked to learn that traveling by air is a practice exclusive to the wealthiest, most privileged people on the planet. When I think of wealthy and rich, flying is not what comes to mind. I do not consider myself a wealthy person, but considering that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot in an airplane, it changes my perspective somewhat. 
 <br><Br>


Whenever I travel by air, I never really stopped to think of the damage that I am causing the environment as a result of flying. I always look to air travel as my first option when I go places. For example, the last time I flew was in the summer on a trip to Canada. I could have easily opted for a more environmentally friendly option such as traveling by train. A train ticket to Canada most likely would have been cheaper too than flying. Instead, I chose to fly because it was more convenient and quicker. After watching this lecture, I hope to be more environmentally aware when making decisions and consider alternative methods of transportation.




</p><hr>



<p>
This was a nice lecture and I had no idea that air travel emits that much CO2, above our yearly allowance. I wish perhaps we can have something to serve to the wealthy people that tells them this is the amount of CO2 they've emitted already hahaha. That would be pretty awesome. 
 <br><Br>

One of the things I was waiting for ken to address was the fact that some people don't have enough vacation days. Now people are constantly working and doesn't have roll over vacation days for slow travel to occur. I agree that traveling by train and bike sounds really fun and provides the rest and time people usually need to sustain themselves but often they just don't have that time. A vacation if often planned around how much time someone can take off. To take a trip to SF, we would need to take off 6 days minimum and we usually only have 4. It would be pretty stressful.

</p><hr>



<p>
After watching the video, I didn't feel great about myself or my carbon footprint considering I travel outside of the country twice a year. Although it is not much compared to some of the frequent flyers, it is a lot compared to the greater majority of the world. I feel guilty knowing that me flying results in a huge amount of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere and that the rest of the world will have to deal with the consequences of something they did not partake in. After Ken had recommended the once a year, long trip to go on with friends and family as opposed to multiple shorter trips throughout the year, I began to take it into consideration. Although this may be possible for me to do in the near future, I don't have any say on when my family decides to take vacations together. And as for taking slow trips to my destination, I would only be able to do that during the summertime when I am more free. I do not think that this way of travel would work for everybody only because those who work may not be able to take extended periods of time off, and would have to fly to and from their destinations. Slow travel seems like a much better alternative to fast travel when someone has the time to do it. It is upsetting to learn just how much carbon dioxide is being emitted into the air from flying. I had no clue that flying would be so detrimental to the environment until Ken had told us in the lecture. We need to come up with a solution and fast. I don't think we will be able to get people to stop flying completely, so maybe we should start off by looking at the kind of fuel the planes are using, and also how they are being built.

As a semi- frequent flyer I’ve had my fair share of long airplane rides. However, I never knew how much of an impact my flying was making on the environment. I’m torn between my passion for environmental protection and my love for traveling. I was shocked when knowing that only 90% of the world has flown on an airplane, as it seemed normalized in my family. I never realized how much of a privilege it was to take semi frequent trips. Part of me has so many places that I want to visit before I pass, but the other is worried that there may not be a future of traveling if we don’t reduce greenhouse gas emissions now. I am also shocked that airplanes are so bad for the environment considering how many times that I’ve seen them fly in the air. Not only is this concerning, but the fact that it is emitting it directly into the atmosphere is also terrible. One question I do have is why is it not more well known how bad travel is for the environment and why isn’t there more money being put into research for cleaner travel?

I thought this video was very interesting and brought up a lot of interesting points and questions. I feel Like Professor Hiltner's solutions such as slow travel are great ideas, however these are definitely not solutions for everyone. In fact I feel like slow travel would not work for most people that I know. While I do think that it would be really fun to go on some sort of biking trip up the California coast some day, I feel like it is kind of unreasonable for most college students to accomplish that. Personally, when I go home from school (by driving), I would not have the time that it would take for slow travel and I'm sure people that live much farther than me would not have that kind of time either. I have taken a train home before and it is something that I will definitely do again, however it is a significantly longer trip, and it also does not go all the way to my home town, so I still need someone to drive at least two hours to where I get off of the train and then drive me back home for another two hours. For people that are able to do this, I think it is a great idea, or even if we are able to do it occasionally, when we do have the time would be great. I definitely agree that we should be flying the least amount possible, however certain people do not have very many options when it comes to going home.

I am not a frequent flyer, but a thought crossed my mind: "Another thing I enjoy that have to be cautious about?!" But after listening further, this does not mean we have to live a dull life at all. We can still do the things we enjoy in ways that are environmentally cautious. It is in our culture to have things immediately without consequence (and that's how we got ourselves into this mess). Slow travel does not seem bad but it is outside of our snap-of-the-finger culture that we would need to get used to. But that does not have to be our only resort. I am so excited for the imaginings of engineers. This is the first time I am hearing about teleprescencing and it sounds so much cooler than flying in a boring, polluting airplane. I have always wanted to travel the world but I would feel so much better if I knew I wasn't badly impacting the climate. 

 <br><Br>

We will enjoy life much more if we took the time to slow down everything--fashion, food, flying. Why are we willing to risk our lives for the rush to have what we want, if we want them to be quality? It seems to be that fast things give us more short term happiness than the slower things. They also lead to more benefits. Sure you may get somewhere faster but now you have emitted more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. However, if you ride your electric bike for 3 days, you will get where you need to go, enjoy some spots along the way, and you'll be a skinny legend (haha).

Before coming to UCSB and attending Ken's Eng 22 and Eng 23 classes, I had seen a TED talk done by him on the subject of air transportation. If I had to take a guess I would say this ranks very highly on his list of things that need to be changed to combat climate change. In his Ted talk he argued that although UCSB is only of the only colleges growing close to releasing net 0 emissions, air travel by UCSB faculty is a major source of the Universities emissions making up 1/3 of total carbon emissions by UCSB. In this video he further explains how plane and jet travel massively increase one's carbon footprint. A takeaway I had from the video was that air travel is one of the more selfish ways you can release carbon into the atmosphere. What I mean by this is that only a select amount of people (1 in every 20, per the video) benefit from using air travel while the whole population has to suffer the consequences. Personally I rarely ever fly, in my life I have only been on two round trip plane rides. So making the change from leaving air travel behind will prove to be an easy adjustment for me to make. However I see how this could be a major issue for many of my peers as some of them live in other states and even other countries. In this video Ken talks about alternative modes of transportation to vacation, including trains and bikes. However this doesn't address the issue of cross-ocean travel. In regards to this I have seen other environmental groups recommended a call back to the technology of sailing, a mode of transportation that does not produce a carbon footprint. However due to the time investment it take to travel the ocean, I don't think many people would be open to this idea. Another alternative would be to reduce air travel to only cross-ocean transportation and for travelers to use different forms of land travel once they arrive on a new continent.

Prior to this video, I never gave much thought to "slow travel." I've always thought that it's best to get where I want to go, as fast as possible. I still believe this holds true for certain situations. For example, my family lives in South Carolina, and I visit every so often. It wouldn't make sense for my mom, who was only able to take a week off work, and I to take the train 3 days there and 3 days back. Despite this I was intrigued in the concept of slow travel if possible. It honestly sounds like fun taking the train across the country with some friends or family and might bring it up as something to do this summer or in the future. I had similar thoughts on the telepresence concept. I worked in a title office this past summer and we used Skype among others things on a weekly basis. I talk with my mom about her work on occasion and always brings up the Skype call she had that day. My point is, I think telepresence already is relatively large. On the other hand, my step-dad used to go on many business trips. He'd always brag about how hands on he was, getting in and doing the dirty work. He would show his employees the best way to go about their newest contracts. Not only this but the effort he would put into them, made him somebody they were happy to work for. I find it somewhat difficult replicate this with telepresence. Over the summer, I would talk to my boss on a weekly basis on Skype and yet I still hardly knew him and didn't build a meaningful business relationship during our 15 minute a week chat. He's recently took a job as a ROTC teacher so doesn't have business trips anymore and is grateful for it. I believe one of the other comments I read pointed out how we get jet lag because we know it's not right to be where we are. My stepdad has made this exact point that airfare did play a role on his body and doesn't miss it. I see the value in telepresence as a very useful alternative to business trips, and as a way to reduce stresses on the body, while also seeing some of its limitations when it comes to the value of actually being somewhere in the flesh brings. I hope telepresence continues to advance and become more useful.

I can relate to this feeling of wanting to reach my destination as fast as I can. I travel every to Mexico during Christmas break just to go and have fun. It just takes 4 hours to get there and I would always complain that it felt too long. I never even came to think that in those 4 hours I was already damaging the world. Now after watching this video, I don’t even feel like traveling anymore. I even think that slow travel can be a better option I do not think that there are trains to go to Mexico but there are I will sure consider that next time. Now, however I think that I use slow travel here as well. My family enjoy going to Napa valley and we live in LA. Maybe if we took the train instead, we could have a much better adventure. In regards to business travel, I wouldn’t know how to comment on that since my father does not air travel for work. But if he did I would actually sit down and ask him if it were possible that he could communicate work thought other electronic forms. I do agree with ken when he brings out that social media has promoted meaningful interactions. I have a lot of friends in Mexico which I don’t see at all or see them once a year when I travel. However, I feel like I can connect with them so well online that at times I think it wouldn’t change anything if I stopped travelling to see them. I can easily facetime them and be happy with that.

I work for an organization that hosts several conferences every year. Part of my responsibilities in said organization is helping organize and run these conferences. These conferences are held all over the country which results in me flying at least 8 times per year (4 conferences each year, roundtrip flights) just for work. I do most of the planning from home, but I have to be present during the conference. In addition, I take at least a dozen more flights every year to visit friends or other pleasure trips. Even if I were to take out all the trips I take for pleasure, I would still have to fly for work. Keep in mind, there are many people that fly much more for their job and it simply would not be realistic for them to take the train. Organs are also flown all across the world for transplant. These are necessary flights that save lives that would be lost if these organs had to be transported by ground. While theorizing about such drastic measures to reduce our carbon footprint might work in a perfect world, it simply does not in the world we live in.

I have never traveled in an airplane before, and after watching this video, it makes me greatly think about the decisions of traveling that I wanted to do later on in my years. To have that much of a carbon footprint when just going on a round trip, I would like to think and hope for better alternative to go to the places that I would want to go to later. I do think that there are better and alternative ways to travel to places, although I do understand that others might hate the time it takes, or are limited in the time span they have do to jobs, responsibilities, and the money amount they have. 
 <br><Br>
I do believe that making a change for the environment is necessary, especially after hearing that a airplane trip from Los Angeles to Paris releases about 3 tons of CO2 directly into the atmosphere. However, I do think that with the environment of people and the workplace today, it might be nearly impossible to both satisfy the environment and one’s own wants.

I had previously learned of the disastrous effects of air travel on the environment in another class that I had taken, but the numbers that Ken was diving into still shocked me to learn. I personally do not fly very often, maybe once every two years on average, and I am now glad that I do not participate in it. The fact that I could have potentially been one of the biggest contributors to climate change despite my current environmentally conscious actions is really hard to bear. 
  <br><Br>

However, the most interesting thing about this lecture was not the sad facts about our detrimental air travel, but the solutions Ken was giving to combat this. I really enjoyed learning about slow travel and I am very interested in trying out something similar, although maybe not all the way to San Francisco like his example stated. I believe that this form of travel would actually increase my sense of enjoyment for traveling. In the past, flying was always the part I disliked the most. Now I have a new adventure to possibly take on and the fact that it is also environmentally friendly gives me even more reason to try it out!

Although I’m very clear with the amount of CO2 emitted by flying, I would say that I’ll still take airplanes as the first choice for long-distance travel. I’m a frequent traveler who takes a 12-hour flight for four to six times per year because that’s the only way for me to visit my home country. As Ken said in the video and also mentioned in class, public transportation is more environmental-friendly. I would love to take airbus or train if I’m traveling to places like LA or San Diego, which is nor that far from Santa Barbara. However, it’s impossible for me to take a train or a bus to the other side of the world. Furthermore, we have to admit that flying is the most efficient transportation so far, there are people flying for business purposes or an emergency, so it makes no sense to ask them to take buses or train. Thus, I would say this video kind of lacks a little further consideration.

After watching Professor Ken Hiltner’s lecture video, I found it shocking how just by taking one flight (from LA to Paris), a person can expend their 2 metric ton CO2 per year limit and double that if it is first class. Also, the fact that 1% of the people who take flights are contributing to 3 metric tons of CO2 is astonishing. Even though I have never taken a flight on an airplane before, I see airplanes passing by all the time from my window here in Santa Barbara. It is hard to imagine that each airplane that passes by is causing so much harm to the environment because it is such a normal sight to see. As someone who does not regularly travel, it was also very disappointing to learn that airplanes are detrimental to the environment because I was hoping to travel in the future. Since I want to reduce my carbon footprint, I will need to reduce the number of flights I would take, better plan vacations, or reconsider traveling overall. At this point, it is important to be more conscious of the decisions we make if we want to be more considerate of our environment.

I found this lecture video especially interesting because of how in the grand scheme of the total global greenhouse emissions flying accounts for little (2.5%) of emissions. Despite this percent being so small, flying remains the worst thing someone can do as a flight from LA to Paris round trip (just 24 hours) could nullify all of your other environmentally friendly actions and expend your allocated greenhouse emissions for a year and a half. As for how plausible it would be to find alternatives to flying I think that some options that Ken discussed in this video could be used in order to avoid flying or at least limit how much one flies. I think a combination of all of the solutions that Ken brought up could be very viable in order to reduce flying. For example the trip from Santa Barbara to San Francisco that Ken mentioned I think it would be most viable to combine the two options of taking a train and using some form of bike or electric bike. For example one could bike from Santa Barbara to San Luis Obispo, explore the area, then take a train to SF. Really any combination of the two I think would be beneficial because I think it would be a more enjoyable experience if one could relax during the train ride and enjoy the exploration of the trip while biking which would make one have a better experience and be more likely to do the trip again instead of getting lazy and flying back down. I think a combination is key (Train from Los Angeles to New York and then fly from New York to Paris) and while combining how to transport around places you could minimize business trips and use facetime technologies to limit flying trips to family members or friends like Ken suggested.

While watching this video I was really intrigued by the fact that most people haven't been on a plane. I never really considered that flying is a major luxury and that some people even though they could choose not to fly. I have flown when visiting the countries my parents are from and even though it wasn't the best for the environment I could safely say it was worth it. Without even knowing professor Hiltner and his solutions to the climate crisis I had practiced his solutions already. The one where people shouldn't do small trips every year, by plane, but rather one big trip every 5 or so. I haven't used the train very often but when I haven't used buses many times and not just in the US. The slow movement is something I will most likely pursue in the future because it lets you really enjoy the journey while saving the planet. The slow food movement is something also plausible for many people including myself. With the ever expanding world of technology I never stopped to think how to use it for the most efficiency for me and the climate. As described by Hiltner in the video facetiming someone across the world is a pretty good option. Albeit it'll never replace actually seeing them in person it is still a good viable option. Flying is an amazing invention but the caveats should really make you think whether you should fly or not.

I am a frequent flyer and I love flying. 
 <br><Br>


As an international student, I fly at least 2 round trips annually and it is across pacific ocean. I guess I must have been a very guilty person. In fact, as many of my peers said, I do not know how should I feel after this video. I recognize myself as a person who cares about climate crisis and acting to promote sustainable lifestyle. Yet, I am still being criticized because I take flights from my home to LA. There is NO OTHER WAY from China to USA other than air travel. And I am adding greenhouse gases simply because I am performing my duty as a student who should go to school on the other side of pacific ocean. What should I do? Should some company open new cruise lines? That takes half a month from US to China, and I only have 21 days in winter break to celebrate new year with my families at home. It is just not practical.
 <br><Br>


I am so frustrated as an environmentalist who is now eating on planet-based diet, travel by foot on campus, and I shop only once per season. I was confident that I had much lower than average carbon footprint. Now I question myself what's the point of all that????

 <br><Br>

As for slow travelling, that is what I tried to promote, too. My friends and I spent three days literally walked through the entire town of Kyoto with only few train travels. It gave us the new understanding of how a trip could and should be like. We have spotted interesting places where rarely tourists go. We found out the true meaning of travelling: live like a local.

It's amazing how as a civilization we've improved enough to create things that take us from one end of the US to the other in three days, but still be frustrated that it isn't fast enough. I find it ironic that to save time, we try to get places faster, but we are actually wasting that time because we're not fully immersed in the moment. We rush, stress about plane tickets, and spend lots of money to buy those plane tickets instead. Why do that when you can have fun during the journey to your destination? It costs less money, so you'll have to work less and have more time to enjoy the trip. Another benefit of slow travel is that you actually experience the area, and with less jet lag. Does it feel right to you to go from one side of the planet to the other in just a day? No, you feel jet lag because something is wrong. Are you really experiencing Paris if you spend only a couple days in it and fly back home? You could live as a local for a couple months, or road trip to experience nearby locations. Backpack Europe. Truly experience the places you go to.

 <br><Br>

I like the idea of slow. I think in our society, we’re rushing and chasing things, to be happier. Trying to get things faster, get places faster, work more to get more things. How can I get more money faster? 
 <br><Br>
Because then we will be happy. But are we happy now? How are your relationships with the people you care about? 
  <br><Br>

On a different note, sometimes, I really don't understand why people are famous for doing bad things. Why are we condoning and even looking up to this behavior? "Jet set"? More like not dealing with the consequences of your actions while inflicting more suffering on people who contribute less to the problem.

I agree with you on taking up the idea of slow. Our culture is embedded with the term "fast," whether it is fast fashion, fast food, fast transportation, or even just a fast lifestyle. For example, the University of California system is designed to be fast. With only ten weeks in a quarter, we're only learning a subject for a little over two months, and the information probably quickly leaves our brain after finals week. This lifestyle that we all live contributes to our fast paced culture on our campus. Often, my peers, including myself, brag about how "productive" we were in our day and how much we could fit in. By doing so, we do things quickly, and pride ourselves in it. We're all caught up in the hustle and bustle of our education system that sometimes we forget to take a step back and enjoy the journey, not just the destination. 

  <br><Br>

I believe this directly translates with modes of transportation. We as a society often pride ourselves with how fast we can get somewhere. Personally, when I go home to Los Angeles (by car) and happen to not be caught up in traffic, I brag to my family and friends that my trip was only an hour and forty five minutes. After watching this video, I started realizing all of the other ways I could get home: by bus, train, or if I had the endurance, bike. When I travel home, I often take many passengers with me from the Rideshare Facebook page. I thought that carpooling would greatly offset my environmental impact, but I now see that it is not enough. There are plenty of options to transport myself from place to place, and I need to take environmental responsibility to help save our planet.

<br><hr>

Well.. we have to go fast, don't we? We say that this is a problem of culture, but it's really not. It's a problem of economics and material conditions. If we keep work schedules and careers and everything else as it is right now, we are going to have to use planes. If we want to have trains become the default form of transit, we are going to have to stop... well.. stop working as much. 
  <br><Br>

American jobs have fewer guaranteed vacation days than any other industrialized country in the world. When we have the rare, rare chance to go on vacation, are we really going to waste three days getting to our destination... if the vacation in itself is only three days? No. Of course not. That would mean that you essentially do not get a vacation at all. 
  <br><Br>

We have vastly few days off; we have no time for leisure. Of course we want to move quickly! We use planes for work travel because we constantly have to be working, and any lost productivity is horrific for US companies. We use planes for personal travel because we have essentially zero days off. 
  <br><Br>

Basically, what I'm saying is... well, we can't just be mad that people are using air travel unless we're willing to change our economic system. Nothing will happen until then.
<br><hr>
Dawn you bring up a lot of good points about our current transit culture. I agree with what you and Ken are saying about immersion in the journey and our need to switch away from being obsessed with "fast." What Ken says about how we avoid the personal approach is all too true. Many of my friends, myself not exempt, do not like to tackle the things we can change about ourselves to help the environment. My close friend, and roommate, attempted to go vegetarian earlier this year. He said that he could last at the very least a week. He managed to go 36 hours before he gave up. I should reduce my almond consumption-- I am cognizant of the fact that each pound of almonds takes almost 1900 gallons of water to produce. However, I still do not want to make the sacrifice of cutting almonds out of my diet. I recognize the points Ken brings up about reducing our usage of Flying. However, sometimes it’s really difficult to cut out that option. My mother currently lives in Seattle, while my father and I live in the Bay Area. In order to visit her I have no choice but to fly as there is no reasonable public transportation from the Bay Area to Seattle. I believe that part of this problem can be solved by the construction of better public transit infrastructure. I think of the options Ken proposes in his lectures, Trains are the most viable potential solution. I hope that one day our infrastructure will look something like Japan’s or Korea’s.

<br><hr>
I totally agree and I like the idea of slow as well. I love the way Dawn put it above that it is ironic that we try to get to places faster, and in turn "we are actually wasting that time because we're not fully immersed in the moment." Fast airplane travel sucks - what is pleasant about it? Thinking about it, slow travel sounds like a much more memorable and fulfilling experience than fast travel. Biking up the California coast to San Francisco, the example Ken gave, sounds like a way better experience than flying for an hour to me. Imagine all of the different places and cool little cities waiting to be discovered, and then finally getting to San Francisco. So much money saved, time well spent and enjoyed, and a greater experience and adventure than flying. Many people are chasing and rushing to get to the next thing, but I know that life is best enjoyed while living in the present and enjoying every bit of the ride. Slow travel and slow food are not only more enjoyable, but they make the final destination that much more worthwhile by truly putting in the effort to get there. I think the slow movement teaches an important lesson in finding peace in the present, rather than projecting to the future to find happiness and pleasure. 
  <br><Br>
After hearing this lecture, I am actually excited to fly less and explore other modes of transportation that sound much more pleasant than air travel, and with the huge bonus of helping the environment. I think that slow travel will become more prominent as people are exposed to the harm of air travel and presented with a new perspective on slow travel. After taking this course for five weeks, I've seen a common theme - we need to slow down our rushed society and enjoy the moment - it will not only make us much happier, but our planet too :).

<br><hr>
Thanks for reminding about the economic reasons for this. It isn’t just the consumer’s fault. I haven’t thought about how they only have a few valuable days to relax from their stressful work. I agree that we need economic change. Maybe something like Juliet Schor’s “Plentitude Economy” where people work less and have more time to enjoy their lives, or something like “Gross National Happiness” in Bhutan in contrast to “GDP” in the US. 
  <br><Br>

Also, of course. It’d be horrific for companies if workers took their time, and weren’t hyper productive, wouldn’t it. :( This reminds me of Valerie’s comment about our obsession with productivity. I think in France, people work less but they are more productive. This would be nice to implement in the US. I would like it if our economy focused more on workers instead of productivity and profits. There seems to be an “economy vs planet” dyad but I think changing the system to have more breaks and slowing things down would improve both the economy and planet.
  <br><Br>

We’re very obsessed with productivity. Our assigned roles… as consumers and producers. Work super hard, spend lots of money, buy lots, waste lots. We’ve taken this role for granted, and learning about the environmental and human import of our actions will help us reevaluate our habits. Keep going with the script or choose the line of flight and make changes. 
  <br><Br>

But anyway, I agree. There needs to be economic changes, not just personal changes.
<br><hr>

I agree with you. If I'm in China, instead of taking a taxi to the airport and fly (two of the most environmental-unfriendly ways of traveling)from Shanghai to Guangzhou which takes about 3 hours, I prefer to take a high-speed train which takes 6 and a half hours. It is wonderful to sit near the window, listening to your favorite music and appreciating the outside scenery. However, if I take a flight instead, all I can see is clouds and sky, and I have to suffer from the loud noise while taking a flight. Moreover, another thing I agree with you is your opinion about jet lag. It took me about 13 hours to fly from the east part of China to LAX, it could be even longer for people who live in the west part of China to reach the United States. I fell asleep at 7 p.m. and woke up at 3 a.m. because of jet lag, and it affected my first week this quarter badly.

<br><hr>
It truly is impressive how our civilization has created such vast improvements to travel, like you said being able to take us from one end of US to the other. And yet, like you said, ironically that still isn't fast enough for so many of us in the US. The first argument you bring up about people not being present in the moment because they always want to go faster was interesting. I agree that sometimes I think people need to slow down and enjoy the moment, so there are definitely times that it would be nice to slow down and enjoy the environment that you are in and become immersed. But, I also think that for business and other things that economically impact the world in ways that will technologically keep on improving our species are a good thing. I would combat parts of your argument that travel for things like vacation and things such as that are better off being used to enjoy the moment and  landscapes of the world. 
  <br><Br>
So in conclusion, I enjoy your idea of slowing society down, I too think that we get too caught up in moving to quickly and rushing our day to day lives. However, I think that some of the improvements we have made will continue to improve and hopefully one day there will be a balance to this quick pace of life and I also hope that we can discover a way to accomplish this that does not impact the environment so negatively.
<br><hr>
I also agree that slow travel can be a whole lot of fun. Whenever I go back home to LA, I usually take the train down the coast. I love this journey. It is slow and peaceful since I can do anything I want without worrying about being car sick. Also, the journey is really beautiful until you get to the city more. The Amtrak travels right on the edge of the beach and the ocean looks beautiful. Once you get into the valley, there are beautiful boulders with oak trees dotted everywhere, which creates a beautiful mountain-like landscape. If I flew from SB to Burbank (the closest airport to my house), for example, I would completely miss this journey. Even driving the fastest way down is down the freeway, where all you can see is other cars and asphalt. 
  <br><Br>
I also like the idea of slow. Even though taking the train to LA takes longer than driving, I usually take the train to save time since I'm able to do productive things while sitting on the train, something I can't do in a car. While the time spent driving is truly just for transportation, time taking the train can be spent eating lunch, working on homework, watching a movie, or catching up on that book you've been meaning to finish. It's also much more relaxing than having to deal with driving and other drivers. If you think about taking the train (the most efficient mode of transportation short of riding your bike or walking), life is technically slower, but much more beautiful. I think we need to stop thinking that the fastest car or the most luxurious private jet is the coolest thing. And how do we know if private jets are cool? I would say that the vast majority of us haven't even been in one! We need to start making taking the train cool. Instead of showing off how much money you have (by taking a private jet), you could show how much gains you got from leg day by biking places.

<br><hr>
I appreciate where you took this comment. I would like to live a slow life. Many of us would and as we have learned, it would be best for the environment. Unfortunately, those of us who would prefer to live a slow life may also be plagued with the idea that the only way to live a pleasurable life is with lots of money. It's even more unfortunate that the ability to travel is a demonstration of one's wealth. traveling fast may be convenient, but I do agree that fast traveling is also a missed chance at exploration. Regarding the use of private jets, I used to view them as the ultimate goal. To be able to go anywhere at anytime seemed to be the indicator of my own success. I never would have considered frequent flying to be an environmental disaster. The fact that airlines offer "frequent flyer" benefits or discounts is terrifying knowing that they are only meant to encourage flying. Passengers need to be aware of the large carbon footprint they are leaving behind when flying.
<br><hr>
I agree with how today's society is trying to move so fast. It really stems from our economy and the fact that if you're not moving too you will get left behind. That's why I do see the "slow living" being a challenge. If the economy stays the way it is we will never really be able to slow down. In order for slow living there needs to be a widespread adoption of minimalism. The less you have and buy there will be less pressure to keep up with society and if society as a whole takes a step or two back we all may be able to take a breather and be able to live slower lives.Again the main issue is getting people on board with the movement because that top 1% will not want to give up what they have.
<br><hr>
This comment has a very positive approach to the idea of not flying. The fact that Ken said about 19/20 people on the planet having never stepped in an airplane was really surprising to me, as myself and most people I know have flown before. It's just another example of the oblivious, greedy Americans in all honesty. I like the idea you suggested about needing to slow down. It's something that should be thought about more. "Stop and smell the roses" is one the most famous quotes of all time, yet we really don't. My only issue is that if you were to travel from, say LA to Paris, there's not really another way to get there besides flying. A solution to this could be like what you said where you fly somewhere and stay there for a long time. Train around. Sounds great to me. 

  <br><Br>

Our world is more connected than it's ever been before. With social media, texting, FaceTime, it's like we can be somewhere with somebody without truly being there. This seems like it would lead to less travel, but I think it may lead to more, because when someone goes somewhere, they can talk about how great it is, telling everyone to come visit. 

  <br><Br>

Private jets are a whole separate issue. I can admit that I grew up thinking that they looked amazing, and that I wanted to fly in one someday, yet I can see now that may not be the best idea. If it's so bad, though, we should be calling people out for them more. Make celebrities feel bad for the pain they're putting the environment through. As a celeb, their whole job is to be liked, so maybe if enough people are mad at them about it, they'll have to listen.

<br><hr>
Mitigating the climate crisis is going to require a "slow" revolution, one that we implement rapidly. We, as a culture, are going to have to restructure our ideas surrounding the fallacy that fast is equivalent to good. I agree with Ken and many other people commenting when they say that taking the train is much more enjoyable than taking a flight when traveling. To get home every break, I set aside an afternoon to take a four hour train down to Fullerton. The scenery is amazing; the tracks hug the coast and cut through mountains. It's far more relaxing than trying to find a rideshare, and less stressful and largely cheaper than buying a plane ticket.
  <br><Br>

Additionally, when people state that the prevalence of air travel isn't due to culture but to "economics" and how industry works in America, I'd argue that those are aspects of culture that we have to change. After having read "The Waste Makers", I think that we need a total shift away from a structure that demands constant, unrelenting work above any other aspects of our lives. If we band together and make institutional change, we'll be able to create a working culture that values downtime, and allows people to be able to make "slow" choices that favor our environment over "convenience". (I'd argue that air travel is fast, but not convenient. It's an entire circus trying to organize a single flight. For the train I mentioned, I pay online, board the train, and have my receipt scanned on my phone. That's convenient, in my opinion.)
  <br><Br>

On a separate but related note, I don't understand why travel is considered to be the epitome of becoming a cultured person, or necessary for "finding yourself." I'm able to read books and access the entire body of human knowledge with a device I carry in my pocket. I've seen photos of places that are across the world from me; I may really want to go to New Zealand, but I probably never will. And that's okay, because I've seen photos of Auckland and Wellington and Tauranga, and the mountains, and the open pastures. I've seen photos of and read scholarly articles about the native flora and fauna. I've read accounts of Maori culture written by Maori people. I've recreated recipes of traditional food from New Zealand, and many other nations, using my phone to Google recipes. I may not travel overseas often, and I may not ever in my life, but I still have a sense of being cultured and open-minded because I live in the information era.

I really didn't know how large the climate footprint flying had. I fly several times a year, so air travel is probably the largest part of my carbon footprint. I dont know if it is practical for me to completely stop flying, but I will definitely be looking for alternatives like taking the train.
  <br><Br>

I don't think flying will go away though, it is too large of an industry. Electric aircraft will likely be a reality in the future as they are already in development. However, I think that improving ground transportation methods would be a better use of resources if the goal is to reduce carbon emissions.

I found pieces of what Ken said interesting. The idea that by easily catching a flight, we are contributing so much and often fulfilling our entire carbon footprint. I personally identify with the type of traveler Ken mentioned in taking trips every four to five years, he specifically targets those that travel more often than say I have recently. Sharing a personal anecdote about his own trip up to San Francisco, the ability he has from a location such as Santa Barbara to northern california is more or less almost central. Due to how he scheduled his trip, he had the ability to spend a couple more days taking the time to enjoy the trip itself. While this is a great alternative, not all 'getaways' allow people the ability to miss more than x amount of days. Ken's suggestion of leaving from Goleta/Santa Barbara and heading to New York, while a great a idea is not tangible for many. A quick search on Amtrak from Goleta to Penn station adds up to just over 3 days straight by train. Which only includes stepping off trains in order to transfer, assuming all other time is spent on board. East coast students for example may not find this a tangible idea due to short breaks such as for Thanksgiving or Spring Break, where most if not all of their time would be spent traveling. A leading factor in traveling via airfare is to cut down on time most heavily. With much of our internal infrastructure, traveling via public transportation long distances can be difficult. For example, Amtrak's evaluation of routes along the east coast, which have been considered in being shut down. Unlike a lot of what is proposed, rather than relying on public infrastructure, I feel an interesting take would be to involve technology in battling the war we've engaged in against oil from the time of Industrialization.

In my watching of this lecture, I was most surprised at Ken's statement that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never even set foot in an airplane, and that just 1% of the population are responsible for 80% of all flights. Before hearing this, I had never considered the small amount of people who actually fly regularly, and thus had never thought about how disproportionate of an effect these "jet-setters" are having on our planet. To me, this seems likes a major injustice, as people who have never even taken a flight, or rarely take flights, must deal with the effects of the massive amount of emissions being released by regular air travelers at no fault of their own.
  <br><Br>


In response to Ken's question regarding how we may reduce air travel, I think that the quickest way to deter excessive airplane use in the short term would be to tax flights for the environmental harm that they cause. This way, people would think more about investing in a flight, and likely choose to travel in other ways, such as by bus or train, instead of unnecessarily flying for a short business trip or nearby conference. Though I think this strategy could have some success in reducing air travel, in the long term I believe we need to make a total cultural shift away from flying, and really need to embrace this "slow travel" movement that Ken mentioned. I believe that if those who fly regularly experienced traveling on train or bus, experiencing new areas to reach a final destination, they would realize that it is not only more environmentally friendly, but actually a lot more enjoyable as well. I always look back fondly at my recent trips down California's coast by way of train, as it was much cheaper than flying and allowed me to see areas of the state that I would have simply flown right over in a plane. Though this transition to "slow travel" will take some time, it is undoubtedly needed to prevent the continuing environmental destruction coming at the hands of needless air travel.

I completely agree. It is a major injustice that people who have never set foot in a plane are going to experience the deadly environmental costs of air travel. I think an environmental tax on flights is a perfect idea to start with in hopes of declining this. I think it would be helpful if private jets were to get a very substantial tax, too, to at least try and curb celebrities from this thoughtless act. Air travel accounts for 2.5 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Although it is not too large, it is something that can be so easily reduced with mindfulness of citizens when traveling. Also, is good to highlight that there is a great alternative to flying: trains. It is also good to know that there are movements coming about to combat flying, which is “slow travel.” In addition to this, there is also “slow food.” Ken explains these as being environmentally friendly and in many ways, preferable to the other options. Slow travel would lead to better mass transit, while impacting the flying industry. 
  <br><Br>

Overall, I think that cutting flying out of our lives completely is unrealistic. It is just too convenient for busy business folk and the top 1% to give up. I think that we can and should do everything in our power to promote slow travel. We can do this by highlighting its attributes, such as enjoying and experiencing the journey as well as the destination. In addition, to slow flights overseas, I suggest that we install more trains that can go underwater, like the one they have going from London to Paris. If trains like these are less environmentally costly than flying, I believe that this is a simple way to limit flying.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I found it crazy that 19 out of 20 people have never set foot on an airplane before. I think it is a major injustice for all the population that has nothing to do with airplanes. They are getting the worst of climate change even though they contributed the least to it. I also agree that the best option to fix excessive flying is to make a cultural shift with flying. There are so many people that fly short distances, including me, instead of driving or taking a bus. Slow travel is not great but it is environmentally better than flying. If we continue on this path the next generations are going to be in terrible shape.
<br><hr>

I just wanted to say that I completely agree on your claim of how surprising and shocking the fact was that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot on an airplane. Even more shocking is the fact that 1% of the world’s population is responsible for 80% of all flights. This is not only sad in the fact that 19 out of 20 people, most likely from third world countries, may never have the opportunity to fly in an airplane, but the fact that they are the ones being most impacted by the detrimental effects of it. I also agree with your proposal that a tax should be placed on flights of all sorts. I believe this would reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases tremendously, and in turn reduce the effects of the climate crisis. that it has on the climate crisis tremendously, and if not, it’s certainly a step in the right direction. 
   <br><Br>
Though I agree with you that the transition to “slow travel” could result in a more enjoyable journey, we have to consider the fact that there’s a reason why the so-called “jet-setters” take fast travel as opposed to slow travel, and it’s in the name. People don’t do it for the experience, they do it for the convenience that it provides them, the convenience being that it gets the job done fast. Most people don’t have enough time to take the slow travel route. For example, Ken brought up the suggestion of biking to SF which would be a round trip of a total of 6 days, not including the days he would spend in SF. The sad truth is that we live in a society where time is always of the essence, which is why people tend to not waste time on slow travel, because time is money, and since we live in a society of materialism, where money is the main priority, that’s just going to make slow travel more and more undesirable.

I’ve always known that air travel produces a significant amount of emissions, but until this lecture I didn’t realize how big that impact really is. The fact that a round trip flight from LA to Paris completely exceeds an individuals CO2 emission allotment for a year is appalling, seeing as how most of the people I know fly much more than that in a year. Many of my friends from home (LA) go to east coast schools, and thus have to fly to and from LA at least 3 times a year. Unfortunately, due to school schedules, they probably would not have time to travel by train, at least for something like Thanksgiving break. I think Ken’s comment about video chats is very important. While it is nice to spend holidays with your family, maybe those who have to travel this much because of school should consider only flying home for one break. They could then maybe FaceTime their family over really short breaks (like Thanksgiving) and then take the train for long breaks (like summer). I think it’s really important to educate people on how significant this environmental impact is. I’m sure many simply don’t realize and once educated, would change their transportation habits. 
   <br><Br>

I like Ken’s comment about changing the way we think about travel to instead enjoy the destination, and not get too caught up in getting to our destination as quickly as possible. I also strongly agree with his suggestion to make one special flight every 5 years, instead of flying multiple times in one year. This could really incentivize people to be thoughtful about the trips they make and could in turn make those travels even more special than they would have otherwise been. In general, this speaks to how important it is to be conscientious about all of our actions in the face of the climate crisis. If we as individuals carefully consider the impact of what we buy, how we travel, how we vote, and how we eat, we can make a significant cultural difference.

While watching the lecture video, I wasn’t shocked to hear that flying is extremely bad for our environment. I was also not surprised that only the wealthy fly regularly since tickets to go pretty much anywhere can be pretty pricey and people that aren’t wealthy either can’t afford them regularly or can’t take time off of work often enough to be able to travel. In the video Ken mentions that 80% of all flights sold are bought by the top 1% of people. You can be a member of the Jet Setter if you fly even if you’re not the top 1%. I was shocked to hear that even if you try to reduce your carbon footprint, if you fly it will nullify your progress. People are only supposed to emit no more than 2 metric tons of CO2 per year, but if you fly from Los Angeles to Paris you would put CO2 into the air for a year and a half, or 3 years if you fly first class. I found this extremely shocking, because even though I knew flying was bad for the environment, I did not know it was actually this bad. I was also shocked to hear that air travel in China has increased by 50%. This is due to the fact that air traveling is becoming more popular in other different countries, which can be bad for our environment if more and more people start to travel by plane.

This lecture was very informative and eye opening. Before watching this lecture I had not realized how only a small percentage of the world's population has access to airplanes. Only 1/20 people have ever been on a plane before and with that being said only 1% of the world’s population makes up 80% of all flights. Ken mentioned that if one flies from LAX to Paris we could expend our entire CO2 allocation for a year and a half. That is insane!! Many of us dream about traveling the world but that’s not something everyone has the privilege of doing (99%). Our planet is suffering from our selfish actions. I think that in order for air travel to decrease and for things like the slow travel movement to take place we must educate the public about the consequences of their actions. I don’t think many people know what they are doing and although it doesn’t make up for their actions we should still educate them. For instance I have lived near an airport my entire life, both back at home and in Santa Barbara. We hear aircraft everyday and many locals never stop to think about how much CO2 they are emitting.

I was very surprised by the information presented in this lecture video. I feel that mostly the focus is placed on cars and the benefits of public transportation, carpooling, or even walking/biking in order to reduce the carbon footprint of each individual. I think this is the first time I have really been given a discussion of the environmental consequences of planes. Hearing Ken explain the amounts of carbon dioxide that is emitted was very shocking and alarming because I feel that this deserves more public attention. Flying is glorified in modern society and seen as a very exciting activity because of the convenience that comes with it. We are able to explore to other parts of the globe at ease, given flight snacks and even shown movies during longer flights. I feel as though the topic of the environmental detriment that comes with flying demonstrates the flawed logic of the current society, anything that makes our lives easier is for the better. There are consequences to every action and just because flying is seen as a luxury does not mean it is a completely perfect mode of transportation. I think a reasonable option for traveling in order to reduce the carbon emissions from flying would be to fly less when possible and not as often, in order to take responsibility of being an inhabitant of a shared planet by millions. For shorter flights, it can be replaced with public transportation instead. Yes, this may increase the amount of time taken to get from one place to another but I personally feel that getting there is part of the experience of traveling, so by taking a step back from wanting "faster" we all need and deserve a break in order to fully immerse ourselves in experience rather than completion.

I was shocked when Ken said that the flight from Los Angeles to Paris, which is a little under 24 hours, could have 3 tons of carbon dioxide emission. I, being someone who would constantly travel by air and each flight sometimes could take up to more than 24 hours, feel a little ashamed of how much I have “contributed” to the climate problems. I understand that the nation-wide trip could be done by taking the train instead of taking the flight, and there are a lot of beautiful views along the way to somewhere that people are planning to go, even going to San Fransico, people could take Amtrack. There are High-Speed Rails in China, which brings much convenience to the people. It is cheaper than the plane tickets but as fast as the plane. I think if America could have more of the High-Speed Rail, people probably would rather choose that instead of the more expansive flights. However, it can not be denied that the students like me, international students, are traveling so frequently with such long distances, I could not find any solutions for it. Am I just going to stay where I come from and let go of the good opportunity of studying abroad? Or being the huge “carbon-dioxide emissioner”.



</p><hr>



<p>

Traveling by flight is very important to me. As an international student, I always went back to my home once a year and have fun with my family. Although I don’t like to travel (because I find it very annoying to pack up my stuff every time), flying back during the summer vacation is something I am looking forward to every year. 
   <br><Br>
    Of course I can be minimalistic, I can incorporate less meat and more vegetables in my diet, I can use more public transportation or bikes, but I am feeling that giving up flying really isn’t something that I will do (and can do) immediately, because there is no alternative for traveling overseas. 
     <br><Br>
  It is true that taking the plane to travel around is very harmful to the environment, and everyday there are just as many people in the airport as any other day. For people who travel regularly, this should be a legitimate concern. But for people like me, who relies on this very transportation going back home, and travel through flight just once a year, the evidence might be a little less motivating. However, I do believe that by raising awareness about the environmental impact that a flight can make, the people who just begin to acquire the privilege to travel by plane can distinguish between when it is necessary to travel by plane and when it is not (and I would like to know more about when it is possible to choose not to go by plane).

I never realized how few people actually use air travel, and yet, its impact is the worst on the environment. While I believe decreased use of cars could be feasible but still quite difficult, I think reducing air travel would be exponentially harder. I definitely believe that business traveling should be limited; personally, I know my uncle flies to England from California almost every month. This is not only difficult when maintaining his lifestyle with his family, but it also results in an enormous carbon footprint. Therefore, transitioning to the telepresence could have multiple benefits. There is also a major problem as social media “influencers” are becoming increasingly more popular, and these public figures travel across the world taking pictures to post on Instagram. Traveling is the key part of the job description, and they usually get around via airplanes. The idea of slow travel as a movement is really interesting and does appeal to me, and hopefully, it can became more popular with these influencers. However, in Ken’s example, he describes a slow travel trip across the California coast, which is only a couple hundred miles. Traveling across continents cannot be achieved in the same way with mass transit or electric bikes, and I think this is where the major issue arises because slow travel can only apply to relatively short distances. I wish I had an answer to how to approach this problem, but I think the only answer would be to minimize the amount of long distance trips that one takes.

I think it’s definitely unfortunate that air travel, one of the innovations of the modern day which has improved personal quality of life and global efficiency to such a great extent, is also the most environmentally damaging. I’ve done a lot of air travel in my life so far, and to be honest, wasn’t really aware of the environmental consequences I was contributing to. While the trips I’ve been on around the world with my family are invaluable to me, I definitely believe that we could have easily incorporated more “slow travel” alternatives. I personally love train rides, and my family always takes advantage of the trains when we’ve traveled to Europe. I think the United States should expand the train and railway system for more high-speed trains, and look to Europe as an example. As for the future, I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to convince people to give up air travel, because as Ken explained, it’s only the top percent of the world who use airplanes, and they are used to it as a lifestyle at this point. It’s hard to give up the time-saving efficiency and convenience of airplanes compared to other modes of transportation. Honestly, I don’t believe we’ll be able to reduce air travel in the future, until / unless the climate crisis gets to a point where people really understand the need to cut back.

This is a very perplexing topic, especially after reading several of my fellow students’ comments… We all seem to be caught in the middle, trying to reduce our carbon footprint in various other ways, but one flight setting back a year or more’s worth of effort. It’s quite unfortunate that flying is the worst thing you can do environmentally. I can’t think of any other ways to travel long distances across continents (other than boats and cruises, which I’m guessing aren’t much better), so I don’t know how realistic it is to cut out air travel. Out of all the alternative options Ken suggested, I think companies probably have the room to cut down business travel. As Ken stated, technology-assisted communication is not the same as face-to-face encounters, but when considering that the climate footprint of telepresencing can be hundred times smaller, humans should adapt and find ways to make telepresencing an efficient form of doing business. Unfortunately, I also think businesses are reluctant to increase telepresencing because face-to-face, personal encounters may help land a deal or make a sale. If competitors continue to meet face-to-face while your company communicates online, companies may fear that their clients may feel under appreciated and less likely to do business with your company. If we’ve learned anything from the climate crisis deniers and fast fashion industry, businesses and people in power will choose the means that produces the most profit over what’s right. I also feel a lot of cognitive dissonance with this because I enjoy traveling and hoped to someday have a job that allows me to travel through work, but now this makes me feel unethical and uneasy.

I myself am a relatively frequent flyer and I do believe that you made many great points supplemented by statistics, but I also do think that time wise, some of your suggestions are a bit too unrealistic. In the state of California and the surrounding western states, it makes a lot of sense to take a train or bus to get to where you are going, but any farther is just inconvenient. Taking a train across the country does seem to be a great experience, as well as terrific for the environment, but the amount of days it takes is just an unrealistic expectation for the average person. People have jobs and school among other things, and flying is the fastest way to fit family trips, business trips, etc. into the average Americans schedule. This is a common issue I have had with a lot of your proposed solutions, convenience. Yes, I believe that everyone could take an extra 30 minutes out of their day to make their own sustainable meals, but in comparison to the amount of time it takes to travel by train versus a plain, it is just too much extra time to add within a 365 day year.

After watching this lecture, I was shocked by some of the statistics concerning airplanes and greenhouse emissions. The worst thing you can do environmentally is fly on airplanes. Airplanes make up for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere.A trip from LA to Paris would release 3 tons of carbon dioxide, and flying first class emits 6 tons of carbon dioxide. Another statistic I found to be interesting was that 19/20 people in the world have never step foot in an airplane. This displays the privilege and wealth difference between the US and other countries and how the US emits way more because of how much more we fly. Moving forward, everyone needs to fly less, especially if it is relatively short distances that could be traveled by a car to.Alternative transportation methods have started to be revived in efforts to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Trains emit far less greenhouse gases than any other transportation method and travels people further distances for less mpg. Bikes are also a very good transportation alternative for shorter distances. Personally, moving forward I am going to ride my bike and contribute to the climate change cause.

Unfortunately, I had a difficult time resonating with Ken’s lecture this week, simply because I never imagined myself becoming a frequent traveler in the future. I understood his argument that air travel plays a detrimental role in contributing to the climate crisis and was surprised to hear of its consequences on greenhouse emissions. Ken points out that one trip from Los Angeles to Paris releases 3 tons of CO2 directly into the atmosphere, and, as a result, you could spend a year’s allotment of CO2 during this flight. I was not aware that the consequences could be so dire. 
     <br><Br>


However, as I stated, I have never seen myself wanting to travel frequently. Even Ken points out that 80% of all flights were made by only 1% of the world’s population, meaning I agree with him that yes, this is a major problem, but it is evident that there is a disparity between those who are privileged and wealthy enough to afford such a trip and those who cannot due to their own circumstances. Especially as students, it would seem far-fetched to listen to lecture on this topic, but I see this as an opportunity to tell other family members and friends about the impacts of air travel, and, despite my thoughts, I do appreciate the way Ken tackles every possible contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and offers realistic solutions for people who want to reduce their carbon footprints.

I too have never really seen myself as becoming a frequent flyer, however, I know many people who are because of the career that they have. My dad has to fly across the country almost every other weekend because of the job that he has and the inability of the company to allow him to work from home for more of the majority of the time. I think that many companies can be the ones to help make this change, if more and more companies allow individuals to work from home, we can help limit the number of frequent flyers. It is not all the individual fault, however, they too should be aware of the carbon impact they are making with all of these flights.

I do enjoy flying and traveling but I do agree with and resonate with Ken's solution of making a grand trip vacation instead of multiple trips every year. This can significantly cut our carbon emissions down while also still having a fun vacation with your family and friends.  Whenever I can I do like to take the train because either it's a good time to spend with your friends and family or it's some time to get things done in a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere. In Europe, the main form of transportation from country to country is by train and when I was in London I had the opportunity to take the train from London to Paris and it was a great experience, similar to flying but without the carbon footprint.


<br><hr>
It's also a complex issue of how familial obligations clash with globalization.
   <br><Br>

When my grandfather passed-away about a month ago, my mother had to fly back to Europe in order to complete some sort of incineration administrative paperwork or what not (plus the funeral and all the other stuff). When people move out of their nations in order to feed their families, there will be collateral in terms of the environmental impact. I realize that only a very small percentage of people in this country would be able to do what my mother did as cross-continent flights are expensive and require a passport (not a given in a this country). I obviously wasn’t going to tell my mother “hey don’t fly back for your father’s funeral because it’s bad for the environment” even though this is TRUE. 
   <br><Br>

These issues brought up by Dr. Hiltner are definitely challenging on a personal level.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that I personally did not resonate with this video as much as the other lecture vides either because I have only ever taken two trips on an airplane my entire life and both trips were within the United States. Even though I may not be a frequent traveler in the slightest, just having me on an airplane even once puts me as the one out of ten people in the world who have ridden a plane. However, the statistic of me being one of the five out of ten people in the United States riding a plane made me feel a lot less guilt. Since I felt a disconnect from this video and my life, none of this seemed important to me, sadly enough. In addition, hearing that air travels only takes up two percent of the planet’s carbon emissions, it doesn’t seem like such a big problem (at least to me). The problem is that this video is mainly being seen by us college students instead of the people who are frequent fliers. Often times, if students are flying, it is because that is the only way to get home from UCSB in a timely manner so that they can have their breaks. Most college students do not have enough money to become frequent fliers because we are spending it on our school tuition, rent, groceries, and the few trips home. I personally take the train home for breaks because I live in LA. The suggestion of riding a bicycle back home is a good idea for my carbon footprint, however, it would be the least safe for me as a woman. Not all of these other options are necessarily available to us students. Sure we can cut down our trips to going back home but then we might have to spend more money staying here due to us now not having access to homecooked meals at the expense of our parents. I believe that this video would be great if the right people saw this, but most of us students are already doing our best on what is available to us and within our price range.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that flying is an extremely privileged practice. I think reacting in offense to this video is more likely if you are a frequent flyer and not reasonating nor feeling guilt is not a result of not caring, but rather not having any connection to contributing to CO2 emissions through air travel.  Though air travel makes up only 2.5% of global greenhouse gases globally, I still think this is a significant number considering that 95% of people have never ridden an airplane. In addition, putting pressure on this is able to hold richer people accountable to an extent because since flying takes up only 2.5% of global greenhouse gases, it is a large amount for such a small population. 
   <br><Br>
This ties up to a recurring idea that we have discussed throughout the class; richer people and countries are more responsible for climate change than the poor are. Like how we saw in this video, this has to do with the exploitation of resources and careless use. I’m sure that there have been times where people who have air traveled could have driven or used public transportation instead. It is easier for them to just air travel, simply because they could afford it. The same is for vacationing; flying anywhere in the world is only available to those who could afford it. 
   <br><Br>
Our professor mentions some good alternatives to air travel; public transportation, less vacations, telopresensing, etc. I think telopresensing is one of the easier alternatives to flying. I’ve always wondered why business people fly to countries in different parts of the world for just a single meeting. Telopresensing actually seems more practical to begin with. Our professor also mentions something called the “slow travel” movement in one of his proposed solutions. “Slow” practices such as slow fashion, slow food, and slow travel all seem like great alternatives to anotherwise “fast” culture.
   <br><Br>
I think one reason why many people are hesitant towards the slow travel movement has to do with both the inaccessibility of finding slow travel to other continents, but also the limited time that many people have due to a fast paced and demanding capitalist society. People aren’t able to travel to other continents that can’t be reached by land vehicles;  however, I believe if there is public investment in “slow” travel, such as boats, etc, people may possibly use it. However, this may not be maximized because of how busy people are. 40 hour work weeks are common in the United States, as opposed to 30 hour work weeks in other countries. The U.S. has one of the least amount of vacation days, sick days, personal days, maternity leaves, etc in the developed world. This may less encourage people to slow travel.
<br><hr>
I completley agree with your comment. Although I have travelled a bit in my lifetime I think that there is definitely a disparity between Ken's argument and the reality of the entire population besides the 1%. Not only those who are struggling students but everyone else who is living in huge poverty. I felt as if him speaking about airplane travel was an lecture better given to the richest people in the population. Regardless it was still an important argument and helped me to learn of the giant pollution of airplanes.

<br><hr>
I also don't consider myself or wish to become a frequent flyer. After reading some of the comments on this video, I realize a lot of students around my age do consider themselves frequent flyers. I do not guilt anyone for their activities worsening the environment, since I am not perfect either. However, the people I would say are more at fault are famous individuals who not only fly as a main form of transportation but also use private jets etc. It is ridiculous to me that money and fame can often disconnect people from the sad reality we are living in. I understand some people have to fly but I also appreciate the tips Ken gave in how to reduce your carbon footprint while still doing the things you enjoy or need to do.

This video's topic frightened me at first because I love to travel. In my mind, the most effective way to get from point A to point B is by plane. The time spent on the plane is merely anticipation for getting to the destination. Hearing what Ken had to say about how this privilege of flying has the ability to double or even triple my carbon footprint filled me with sadness because I try very hard to live a sustainable life. I don't eat meat, I try not to partake in the single-use plastic products, and I make many other small contributions to try and lower my carbon footprint when all of this work is wiped away by a trip on an airplane. 

   <br><Br>

I also think Ken touched on a topic that is not only true about travel, but about our American lifestyle in general. People need to slow down. When I think about common lifestyles in today's world, they are categorized by moving fast. We want fast food, fast fashion, fast travel. We want instant gratification and that leads to an incredibly wasteful way of life. When we want things fast, there are short cuts taken that often negatively impact the planet. This is demonstrated by the example of flying. People want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible and that leads to air travel which emits an incredible amount of carbon dioxide. At first, Ken's idea of slow travel seemed very unappealing to me, like the journey would be agony while it dragged on towards my destination. It came to me, however, that on this journey there would be much to experience and not only could I reap the enlightening benefits of my actual destination, but also the journey towards it. A big issue in today's world is that we just need to slow down, as Ken states. Once we stop focusing on instant gratification, we take time to appreciate the journey, and the earth just a little bit more.

I too, love to travel and I tend to always use a plane to get from one place to another. Flying once or twice a year I never thought of the major impacts that it has on the environment. I also try my best to live a sustainable life but it turns out that all of that hard work to that kind of life wasn’t working because of the amount that I partake in plane use. I believe the best way for me to both fulfill my love for traveling and living the sustainable life is to consolidate and switch to train for half or more of the trip.

After reading this collection, I have a lot of thinking. I saw the appeal about the impact of air travel on the environment and less air travel as early as a long time ago. I didn't take it seriously when I saw it before. First, I don't think it's true. Maybe air travel doesn't pollute the environment as advertised. Of course, it's a bit of fluke and unwilling to admit it. Second, I remember that it is inevitable to travel by air. As the professor said, when people travel by air for work or travel, it is necessary and cannot be reduced. However, I also agree with reducing the number of air travel, such as going to a large-scale trip a few years to reduce carbon emissions. The professor also mentioned the way to travel by train or even by bike. Once I was also looking forward to such a trip. It's really good to spend time and enjoy the scenery along the way. Then the travel time is less and less as you are more and more busy. It's hard to find opportunities for family to travel together. If you spend too much time on the road, you will have little time to relax in the destination. Life is not always about destination but journey.
   <br><Br>

In a word, I think we need to balance the travel time we have with the way we travel. I believe that air travel is really harmful to climate change, but when we don't have much time, we can't adopt other travel methods. But if I have enough time, I would prefer to travel more slowly and enjoy the scenery along the way.

This is where you lost me, Ken. I understand how bad environmentally travelling in planes can be, but then you change peoples' lives in terms of their time management. People are very busy, any travelling by train would require much more time set aside prior to the actual vacation. Also, no offense Ken, but I would MUCH rather travel via airplane to see my family that's in Mexico than "Facetime or Skype". It's also bold to assume that everyone has easy access to that sort of technology. I don't know about you, but I'd feel very guilty and depressed if I don't see my grandma one last time before time catches up.

   <br><Br>

I don't want to be a Kardashian, but I do want to travel the world and experience new cultures. It has been proven that travelling essentially makes us "smarter" (word that the Forbes article used). How would it make us smarter? It allows us to experience new cultures and ideas, which then in turn make us more open minded. The study that was done for this showed results that people who traveled more were able to understand a different perspective over an issue much easier than their counterpart. 
   <br><Br>


Now I don't want to use that as an "excuse" to continue flying. My argument on this is that I would rather fly around the world for life experiences than be a consumer in society. Just last week I was thinking "If to be a minimalist you need to stop buying the extras and only keep the necessities, then I would use that large amount of possible savings to do what I want in life, which is to travel the world." The positive attribute that Ryan and Joshua were trying to argue is that minimalism gives more freedom, so how else would we express that freedom?

Before watching this video, I was totally unaware of how environmentally disastrous flying is. Like most people, I saw traveling by plane as a necessity to reach a far away destination, rather than considering more lengthy or (honestly) inconvenient options. I’ll admit, I’ve even taken a flight home from Santa Barbara to Oakland since I do not have a car and the flight was cheap and convenient. This complacency about the environmental impact of common action resonates through our society and the entirety of the climate crisis. We are not easily educated about the emissions produced by flying unless we specifically go look for the information. Whether it’s complete obliviousness or planned obsolescence by big business, this is just one example that shows that we need to change the ways we educate the public about their carbon footprints. The fact that flying uses up all or more of one’s carbon budget for the entire year shocked me, and I bet it would shock most people as well. This shock factor is one of our tools we can use to gather people towards changing their lifestyles. 
   <br><Br>
Additionally, after watching the video, I did have a few questions. Does each person on the flight emit 2 metric tons? How much is the amount that the entire flight emits? How can we incentivize other forms of travel despite their downsides?

I've never been a big proponent of air travel. I can count the number of times I've went on a plane or traveled out of state on a single hand. However, my family takes more frequent trips due to familial connections throughout the world. I tended to abstain for a variety of reasons. I wish I could attribute that solely to environmental activism, but that would just be lying. And I can definitely see the appeal of traveling. In the many icebreakers that I've been forced to talk in throughout my time at this school, travel is often an answer to the question of what they want to do more of in their life. Now that air travel over large distances is a more accessible commodity, I just don't see it disappearing anytime soon. It will continue to become cheaper and more attractive as traveling becomes even more popularized in social media. This status quo is strengthening day by day and similarly to cars, I have a less than optimistic view of it changing anytime soon even with the environmental consequences. The slow travel, fantasy trip described by Ken has an upside of an opportunity for deeper memories to be made in comparison to a direct flight down to a destination. But, it just isn't as convenient nor is it a favorable option when the duration vacation days/breaks granted by work or school are short and few and far between. It will take an upheaval, particularly by the upper brass in the government, for that to change anytime soon.

After watching Ken’s lecture video, just like many other students in the comment section, I was shocked and surprised to see how environmentally harmful and disastrous flying is. I do not fly frequently as I only fly when traveling, but the fact that flying is very damaging to our environment still comes as a huge surprise for me. However, a lot of others around us still do not know the true harms and negative impacts of air travel as a majority of people would indefinitely prefer flying over taking mass transit or driving simply due to the high convenience of air travel because it can take people to their destination in the shortest amount of time. The statistics of only 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot in a plane greatly shocked me as well because this piece of evidence really goes to show that flying is really a privileged activity for the well-to-do. 

   <br><Br>

Another interesting point that Ken brought up during the lecture video was the emerging movement of slow travel along with slow food and slow fashion. I actually have heard about slow travel maybe once or twice before but I dismissed it as some kind of trend on Instagram or other social media platforms until now that I realized this is a real movement that is well underway to its rising popularity in modern society. I have never traveled by train before so this suggestion sounds very appealing to me because I will have the opportunity to explore the beautiful coastal areas and other natural landscapes of California. Sure, taking the plane may be a lot faster but if I am not in a rush then I think I would totally go for slow travel and mass transit such as trains as I would love to take my time to sit back and relax and rewind to the wonderful sightseeings outside. 
   <br><Br>


I do agree, though, that it would be more difficult for people to reduce their business trips and business flying because flying is very convenient and does not waste much time in a business trip, but people can still try to fly a little less and not go on unnecessary business trips knowing the huge carbon footprints and disastrous environmental impacts from air travel during those business trips. Just as Ken mentioned at the end of the video, with the advancing technology today people can virtually meet face-to-face through their smartphones, laptops, and other technological devices. Those technologies and their features should be utilized more for business people that instead of flying to a foreign country for a meeting or conference people can just attend the meeting or conference via Skype or Facetime, hence reducing their carbon footprint and their contribution to the climate crisis.

I appreciate that you include numerical figures in your lectures to make more clear the negative effects of different things. However, I don't understand how flying first class is 2 times as bad for the environment as flying coach. Also, you said life is about the journey and not about the destination, but if your journey (let's say time with family) happens once you get to a specific location, and you have a limited amount of time you can spend there, you would probably want to get there quickly. That being said, I think the train idea is still good, but the bike idea probably wouldn't be the best choice in that situation if you need to travel hundreds of miles to get to your desired location.

As someone who has flown more than my fair share, I was unaware of how devastating flight was at a per capita level.  I really liked the way Ken presented the facts, explaining both how flight was destructive and how it was unnecessary in most cases.

It seems to me that most of the problems regarding all forms of travel will be resolved by the implementation of a national system of rails.  This would allow for high speed trains across the continental U.S. in approximately 10 hours.  That is not significantly longer than all the work and time put into going through an airport and waiting for the flight.  The nice thing about this is it would let you take only one shorter flight to cross the Atlantic ocean rather than 2 medium flights or one very long flight.  Furthermore, as trains would connect most cities, it would be more convenient than going to the nearest city with a major airport.  

   <br><Br>

Lastly, a nice benefit of both high speed rail and the idea of slow travel is that they let you appreciate nature and the inherent beauty of our country.  Most people only care about the destination and not at all about the trip, which is a real shame.  Though the destination is often important, the journey can be just as memorable.  I remember hiking 104 miles over 10 days in New Mexico.  Though it was difficult, I saw many things I would have never seen and felt a strong sense of accomplishment at the end that I would not have had if I had driven the entire distance.

Examples like Ken's bike trip idea and your hiking for ten days are the very stories that I think need to get out there more. It's honestly quite fantastical and alluring to think about, as opposed to sitting crammed in plane seats with snoring passengers, yet I feel as though many don't believe there to be any other possible alternatives, when that's just not the case. Humans tend to choose the easiest options, but I believe our culture needs to start the shift into realizing what's important, such as saving out planet environmentally, as well as saving our livelihoods by getting out more and just exploring the beautiful world around us.

Watching video has me left in a state of limbo, as one half of me is drawn to the idea of forsaking fast travel and embracing a life of slow travel, emphasizing a journey rather than having a final destination. That idea, although ideal and sustainable, also seems fantastical and far reaching. I think it is a safe bet to assume that many of you feel this way too after watching this lecture. How could I leave behind traveling? I understand that not everyone may be willing or able, physically, financially, or otherwise, to be able to travel, and I fully understand my privilege in having been able to dip my toes in the water of this exploration. All of this considered, I feel sad knowing that such a passion of mine is so terrible for this planet. I am drawn to the idea of slow traveling, as forsaking traveling in general is unbearable to think, but part of me wonders: who has enough time to bike across a state? I know that sounds silly, but in my personal life, I just cannot comprehend that idea because of the lack of time in my own life between work, school, and the rest. A recurring theme in this class seems to be that the idea of convenience is not going to save the planet, and that idea we must truly take seriously. I am so happy, although frequently conflicted, that I am being challenged to reflect on my passions, priorities, and the consequences of both of those aspects. I guess the only answer to who has time is no one, BUT who is the person or institution telling us we can't MAKE TIME. It is up to us to reject those guidelines and start something completely new. This is our time to reinvent what it means to travel and experience. Watching this video has allowed me to see, that every thing we love needs a chance to be reevaluated; we all just have to make. time.

Being someone, who admittedly travels more than once a year, reading the title of this lecture alone was enough to leave me feeling rather guilty and I was to be honest dreading hearing how I’ve massively caused detriment to the planet. Now, although flying only accounts for 2.5% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, which is less than the effect of eating beef, it’s still extremely bad for the planet. This is because 19/20 or 95% of the people on the planet have never even entered a plane. This means that 5% of the entire population of the world creates 2.5% of the global GHG emissions, which is an extremely large percentage for that small of a population. What I find kind of upsetting is that I know my family, in particular my dad is one of those 1% of the population that participate in 80% of the flights. While, I know for a fact that he would rather converse over conference calls or over the phone, he seldom has to fly sometimes up to 5-6 times a month to keep up with the demands of his job. That means that my dad has probably already maximized his allowance for the next 20/30 years of his life, possibly even for the rest of his life. In addition, living abroad I also have tomake trips back home during the summer and in winter break to see my family. There is no alternative for me like there is for people for example living within the US. While I’d love to take a bus and then maybe sail over, basically half of the oceans, my holiday would be over by the time I get there. Therefore, I wonder if there could be another alternative to maybe making planes themselves more environmentally friendly, like possibly having an electric plane of some sorts or a plane that emits less CO2. I however, agree completely with what Ken said in that we don’t like to listen to these kind of talks because it makes us look at our own actions, not the actions of some politician or company. Knowing that one round trip to London I emit 3 tons of CO2, not the plane, not the pilot, me! Internalizes the guilt and the blame and therefore does not allow me or anyone else to continue to point the fingers so they can alleviate any kind of responsibility off their backs. One thing I will say, is that Ken’s suggestion of the slow travel movement is a great one that will not only change the world’s economics but in a world that I think has become so jet-set ready, It will allow people to converse with more people, as they are able to visit more destinations that they would normally simply fly over.

Watching Ken’s videos, my thoughts on the subject was very conflicting. On one hand, I have my own selfish desires to travel around the world. On the other hand I know it is possible to live a perfectly happy and fulfilling life, just staying in California. After all, if it’s possible for that other 95% of the world’s population to do, why should it be any different for me? 
   <br><Br>

I know a lot of you are disagreeing with ken in the comments, but I really don’t think he meant his suggestions in such extremist ways. Just like minimalism and vegetarianism, it is not necessarily so black and white. You don’t have to get rid of everything you own or be completely vegan in order to make a difference. Just by reducing the amount of superfrivalous items that you purchase or forgoing meat once every week is already much better than not trying because you can’t live the lifestyle to its fullest. 
   <br><Br>

I don’t think that’s what he was trying to say was completely give up air travel all together, especially when you don’t have much of a choice. I think it’s more when you can make the choice to do slow travel or travel more locally, choose that rather than the more ecologically destructive option of flying. For example, even though flying would only take 2 hrs round trip from SB to SF and driving takes 10+, I always drive. (Albeit, I did this more to save money than out of concern for the environment. It is definitely possible to make better options and it is not as black and white as some of the comments are portraying.

My home town came on CBS News a few days ago and had a segment talking about how the city is going to help solve the "looming global pilot shortage." They put funding into installing air craft simulators in one of their elementary schools and also offer aviation courses at a local junior college. I find it interesting that when not viewing this from an environmental stand point this seems like good news, there will be more people hired as pilots so they don't run out and in the years to come more and more people will be well trained in flying. But being an environmentalist just makes me realize how disastrous this news is. The children in the town have no realization the terrible effects flying has on the environment and will just be enforced with the idea that flying is revolutionary and the best way to travel, flying could even become a passion for them. It saddens me that many people in my home town come from poor families so they may see this as a way out of achieving a better future, but in reality it will lead us to having no future at all.

The thing about flying is, it is so convenient and relatively cheap for traveling across the ocean. There is also the issue with time restraints if not flying on plane, because riding the train or bus or biking some of the way as Ken mentioned takes up a considerable chunk of time. Most people who have busy schedules and can't take much time off from work cannot afford to go that route if they need to travel somewhere for the weekend. I know flying is just too convenient to become obsolete any time soon, so I'm interested in the technologies of the future that will help reduce the carbon emissions of flying. Hopefully we will implement a better high-speed rail system throughout the United States to reduce the number of domestic flights. 

   <br><Br>

Living here in Santa Barbara without a car really forces me to think carefully about the way that I travel. Since I have a free bus pass through my student ID,  I am more inclined to take the bus everywhere rather than Uber or Lyft. Having a bike also helps and gives me some sense of freedom of mobility with the absence of a car. I've become so comfortable with public transportation that I'd rather take the bus or train than ask anyone for a ride when I visit LA, and I'm comfortable with the idea of taking a train to San Francisco or Las Vegas to visit some friends, which I might do very soon. Hopefully the culture around public transportation shifts and more people become comfortable with using it as their main mode of transportation rather than going directly to cars or planes.

Out of the alternatives to air travel that Ken listed, I think telepresencing is the easiest to achieve.  Even though it will almost always be easier to hold a conversation face to face, a video call is not that much more inconvenient.  When considering the amount of environmental damage we can avoid by video calling instead of flying, the negatives seem much more minor.   We have such useful technology in our hands, so we should utilize it more.  I often miss my grandparents, and I still go back once a year to see them.  For the rest of the year, however, I keep in touch through video and phone calls.  I don’t need to fly back every time I want to see them.  We should definitely make a practice of using telepresencing as an alternative to flying.

<p>
After watching Ken's video about flying, I learned that flying is one of the worst contributions to climate change because of the amount of CO2 emissions it can produce onto the environment. It is astonishing to learn that flying as an option for transportation is only taken by one percent of the world's population. This makes me realize that I live in such a comfortable and maybe privileged environment. However, with this comfort and privilege, comes a huge cost to the planet. I hope scientists can figure out another form of transportation across the globe where the people can go anywhere but with minimal amount of damage onto our planet. Right now, developed countries are having more opportunities on flying; however, if we can, we must figure out on how to help the environment because if our flying patterns continue without regards to the safety of our homes, there could nothing left that we can call home itself.

Although it’s hard to cut off all of the air travel immediately, it’s possible for us to reduce the flights we are taking and change our travel choices in a shorter time. The encouragement on trains, buses routes, and ships can hugely affect our decisions sometimes, since such means not only reduce our financial burden, but also cost less to the environment. Before I watched this lecture, I did not know that the air travel can have such a huge influence on increasing carbon footprint. I remembered that in the English 22 class, professor Ken even advised us Chinese international students to ride ships to return to the United States after summer break. That sounds like a joke, but it will definitely save our carbon footprint and be friendly to the planet. And it’s of great significance for us to change our habits from choosing the fastest and most harmful way to a more financially and environmentally friendly way for travel.

While I don't fly often (maybe once a year), the idea that even flying once per year makes me part of the jet-setting elite is something I never really thought about before taking classes with Ken. He introduced this idea in English 22 last quarter and it was something I thought about when I ended up later taking a round trip flight to the Midwest on a trip to see my boyfriend's family. As an ES major with strong beliefs in taking personal responsibility for my global footprint, it's one of the toughest lifestyle changes to work around. I am lucky enough to have all of my own family and friends close enough to where regular flying isn't necessary, but I feel for people that don't live with these same circumstances. My boyfriend, for instance, flies home frequently for bigger holidays which are extremely important to his family and I can't really imagine how the conversation would go if he were to skip any one of those on the sole basis of reducing his carbon footprint.
    <br><Br>

Unfortunately I don't think commercial flights are getting less popular. Just recently the Santa Maria airport announced it is adding flights to LAX, Denver, and some other hubs - making flying even more accessible for people in the central coast. The California High Speed Rail project gives some hope for quick and greener transportation in California but the issues that it has faced thus far with funding and delays illustrates how much harder it is to build the infrastructure for train travel. Hopefully it turns out to be a success so that other projects like it get started.

Per usual, there are a lot of things about flying that I never really knew until Ken brought up these great points. For example, I am shocked to learn that the toll our planet takes doubles when we choose to fly first class rather than coach or a different aspect of airlines. Although it only accounts for 2%, the fact that many of us in America do fly indicates that we are part of the wealthier section of the world. When Ken said that only 19 out of 20 people in the world have flown on an airplane, I was shocked, not only by the fact that so few have been on an airplane, but I realized how lucky I am to have had the opportunity to fly when I am now much more understanding of how many people have not had the same opportunity.

This lecture, more than any other, really hits home for me. In 2019, I traveled more than I have throughout my entire life, going on 6 different trips that required multiple layovers each, and having the chance to see the amazing world that we do live in. I believed that trip to only have benefits; traveling the world opens you to a totally different perspective than the one you have. Traveling and seeing new places adds more to one’s soul. I thought that was an amazing experience; that there was nothing that could have been considered negative when it comes to flying. However, after watching this video, it makes me really think about how my travelling really affected the planet. 

    <br><Br>

What I did disagree about is when Ken discussed using phones and facetiming and alternatives to seeing someone face to face. There is no substitute to seeing someone in person, and I do not think that I would ever avoid flying in order to save the planet and not have the chance to see my family or close friends. To me, the people that I hold dear to my heart are the most important thing in my entire life, and I would do anything to be able to spend time with them. Part of the consequences of having a global family is having to fly, but even with knowing this information, I would not regret it for one second. I would gladly take the blame for hurting our climate or causing global warming to occur, but nothing will change that .

I agree with you on the point that video chats can never replace the face to face communication. It's very tricky to think about the environmental impact behind traveling with planes. To save our planet, we better just stay at homes and never go to places where you can get to only through flying and rely on technology instead? There is a huge difference between watching and talking in front of screens and actually being there in person and communicating with our verbal and non-verbal cues. The idea that flying can just easily singlehandedly nullify all the gains from the rest of my otherwise environmentally conscientious lifestyle is just too extreme for me, and hard to implement under such condition. I like to see the rest of the world and connect with people in person. I will definitely reduce the unnecessary flights in the future, but I hope there is a relatively better solution rather than just giving up flying.

I feel like it's a bit of a tragic irony, I have a friend who wants to devote their entire life to helping the planet, however she believes this means travelling the world. I've tried to tell her otherwise, but she remains adamant that it's not as much of a deal, when in reality every action she takes will be nullified by the travelling she partakes in. It makes sense that flying doesn't show up as such a huge factor of CO2 emissions on the charts due to the small percentage of fliers, and I feel as though this is something that somewhat validates fliers to continue in their harmful habits. In truth flying is one of the most harmful things anyone could participate in.

    <br><Br>

I've only recently started flying. Last year was my very first time stepping side a plane, however since then I've used in quite a few times. Just flying home for winter break this year, which would alternatively be a 7 hour car drive or a 12 hour train ride, now seems like such an unnecessary action and I'm quite regretful. Although, I'm glad I've realized my actions since starting college this year. Better to catch on sooner than later. In fact, Ken's suggestion of a train across the country or even a bike adventure taking pit-stops in locations you likely wouldn't have even turned an eye towards in any other instance actually sounds like one of the coolest things. I've always spoken of partaking in an adventure, and honestly that sounds like one the most ideal options ever. I definitely think people should take a look at the alternatives, as not everything is as drab or dull as people might imagine it to be. These suggestions spoke lengths to me and I'm actually excited to plan out my next trip, making that be through some sort of public land transportation.

Before watching this video, I knew flying should somehow have impact toward the environment. Nevertheless, I did not realize such a causal flying record could affect our environment in a.negative way. Ken also mentioned that if only 5% of world's population are responsible for air travel, what will happen for the rest? He then mentioned in China,  air travel recently increased by 50% in just 5 years. So what we can do to change this horrible situation which could reduce less impact to our environment? The answer is to "fly less". I totally agree with this idea since it is necessary for us to put a little effort toward environmental protection. We cannot always wait for others to take action, it is our responsibility to protect our homeland.
    <br><Br>

Ken also mentioned that we could find other ways to travel instead of travel by plane. For example, he illustrated that he can travel by riding the electric bike and spending the rest of his time exploring the local area or in airbnb. I believe this is a great way to travel. Not only we can enjoy ourselves but also we can reduce CO2 emission.

I agree with most of your points that you made throughout your comment. I could not believe that flying is the best way to cause the most harm to the planet as quickly as possible, even though airplanes only account for 2% of carbon emissions. The fact that you could stop shopping at the mall and start shopping at thrift stores instead, and you could give up your current diet and adopt a vegan diet in an effort to be more environmentally friendly, but if you simply take one round trip in a plane all of your other environmentally friendly actives could be nullified. After hearing about how harmful flying is to the environment, yet only a small population has ever taken a trip on a plane makes me optimistic that we can reduce flying even more. I found the slow travel movement really interesting, but there are some significant flaws with the plan. For instance, I don't know if I would personally be willing to take a train across to New York because of the large time commitment. Taking the train to New York City would take a lot more time compared to merely flying over. Traveling for that long in a train would also be a lot more tiring than if you were going to take a plane ride. However, there are certain distances that don't require flying. For example, I live four and a half hours from here, and while flying home would be faster and more convenient at times, it is unnecessary and the benefits do not outweigh the costs. Not only would I be spending a lot more than I would spend on a train ticket, but I would be harming the planet more if I were to take a plane than if I were to go on a train. I want to be able to travel in the future, but after learning about the consequences of flying I will find alternative ways to get from place to place rather than automatically flying there because of the convinence.

This lecture was eye opening and informative. I was unaware of just how damaging flying in an airplane is for the environment. I also didn’t know how rare air travel is among the population of the earth. The fact that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot on an airplane surprised me. I figured it had to be a little more than that. However, it is actually a good thing that flying is this rare because there would be far more damage being done to the planet if more people could fly, much greater than 2.5% of carbon emissions. The sad part is that people aren’t slowing down with air travel. People will continue to travel in airplanes. I’m even flying to New York for spring break, but what am I supposed to do? Traveling by train would take a week and I don’t have that time! Maybe in the future, if enough people realize the damage flying does, the flying rate will go down.
    <br><Br>

I enjoyed the comparison Ken made of traveling by plane versus slow travel, and buying ingredients at a farmers’ market then preparing and cooking it versus a fast food restaurant. This is a pretty efficient comparison because fast food is much more damaging to your body, and air travel is much more damaging to the environment. One is easier with quicker results, but more damaging, and the other takes more time and is harder to do, but is better for the user/consumer. It makes me feel conflicted though, because I cook and rarely eat fast food, but I fly in airplanes when I travel.

I completely agree with you! I was also shocked to see the number of people who have never been on a plane was 19 out of 20 people. I would have expected this number to be way higher considering how often I hear of people traveling but you’re right when you mention that if it were higher than it would be way more than 2.5% of carbon emissions. I was also shocked to see that the number doubles when a person is flying in first class. I love to travel so watching this lecture video did make me feel guilty. I also see your point when you mentioned you have a trip to New York and it would take way longer to travel by plane. I also have this mindset when traveling to other states or going to Mexico. I would much rather spend a couple of hours on a plane than spend a couple days traveling on a train. But, I think I should start to reconsider this and start to incorporate traveling by bus or trains due to the positive impact it could have on our environment.

I fly a lot. Living in Chicago it is almost natural for me to hop on a plane for up to six hours to see friends and family all over the continent and occasionally all over the world. Yet what was most striking to me about this was that, in order to be living what one could call a traditionally eco-friendly lifestyle, I can't really take any of these trips. And, the length of these trips would probably have to change in a very fundamental way considering how, just this last year, I flew to Europe for only six days. 
     <br><Br>
Yet a change in flying does not strike me as a cultural change in the same vein as a change in how we commute or travel around cities. A change in flying is more of a change in the way businesses operate in the world of climate change. My father, for example, travels to Saudi Arabia and Israel for business, typically only going for around four days at a time. If he were to reduce his output in terms of travel he would not only have to adjust the way his business operates, but also have the nature of his business change along with it--giving him more vacation time to even out the cost of his trips and also switching to video chat meetings instead of face-to-face meetings. The only problem is: I don't see these changes coming any time soon.

Throughout the video I kept thinking about the relationships that we have with freedom happiness and travel. I really cannot think of a person I know that, if asked what they wanted to do if they were not working or at school, would not promptly say that they wanted to travel the world. I think this is very much a universal idea that is only heightened by globalization and our access to knowledge of the worlds cultures. Everyone wants to travel, our desire to explore new places and embrace new cultures is not a bad thing. Its hard to imagine this human sentiment not being included with the air travel discussion. I think our lifestyles do not compliment slow travel very well. With the majority of people only able to take very limited amounts of time off work, it would make sense that they would want to increase their time away with a quick flight to their destination. Perhaps a better approach then just asking people not to fly so often would be to change our relationship with free time. If something like a 30 hour work week mentioned in a previous lecture, were regularly practiced, we would perhaps have much more time to travel and travel slowly. I think its also a good idea to make use of the technological availability of knowledge. We are in a time where we can learn so much about many places without every actually going to them. Sure there is not nearly as much satisfaction seeing something on a screen as opposed to in person. But, I ask myself if it would be better to have a sense of connectedness and deep tie to a particular place where I call home or to be simply a visitor to many many places whose cultures and identities I cannot call my own.

I find this comment particularly interesting in exploring our desire to travel and learn about different cultures under the context of globalization. Indeed, globalization has provided us with the opportunity to reach most places on the planet. Everyone would like to witness things that they did not have a chance to see. Some people also take their old parents to travel and get them to know coutures and anecdotes that they never had a chance to. Of course it would be unreasonable to deny such desire to explore since curiosity is part of our nature, but such trips would mostly require flying. It is not enough to just promote the idea about slow travel, but how to make it possible for people to have a different experience in places faraway from their home is also a problem. By slow travel, it is almost impossible for people achieve their goal, unless they have plenty of time to travel to the other half of the planet in slowly. One possible way that I can think about is the holographic technique combined with virtual reality to help construct a different experience, which is somehow possible with our technology now. Another method would be to develop a quick transportation system with extremely low carbon emission; yet, this is far beyond our reach in terms of technology now.

This is a lecture video that I enjoyed, mostly because it really hit home. I was uncomfortable with the fact that 80% of air travel is done by 1% of people, and uncomfortable with the fact that I will be consciously aware of my environmental impact every time I step foot on a plane to go back home. I don’t think i have ever felt so far away from home than I did in that moment. When Ken started talking about solutions, he reminded me of this woman I met in Marseille last summer. My best friend and I did the interrail through Europe, which involved taking a lot of trains and running into a lot of cool people. There was one woman who was going to her sister's wedding off the coast of Barcelona. She was coming from Berlin. Instead of flying along with her entire family, she had decided that it was better to take trains. My friend and I were impressed with her dedication to decreasing her carbon footprint, but it seemed a little bit time inefficient. I think if there was more time for vacations and things like that, the speed that flying grants would be less sought out for. 

     <br><Br>



I think business travel will probably decrease because it can be easily replaced by other forms of telecommunications. I can even imagine that prices of air travel will cause normal people to decrease the frequency of flying. However, in terms of deciding whether to fly for an hour or take a 3 day trip, a lot of people would choose the former. I also think it would be interesting if flying does stop, which would mean tourism would cease and major hotspots would lose a lot of their economic prosperity. Not only that, but the north and south american continent would be very isolated. I don’t think that would be a good thing in terms of patriotism and trying to get people to feel like everyone is similar. Europe is made up of many countries, so no flying would not stop the bridging and interaction of cultures. The americas would be isolated, and I can only imagine what that would do for the American state of mind.

It’s surprising to find out that even though the flight only contributes to around 2 percent greenhouse gas emission, it’s still the most problematic transportation for our planet. I have never known that each round of flight per person will make 3 tons of the greenhouse gas directly into the atmosphere, and the first class will produce even twice. However, I don’t think it’s easy fro people to fly less, since air fly is such a convenient and fast way for people to both travel and do business. Unless there will be improvement in other choice of transportation like faster train to get around,
     <br><Br>
the number of people who chose flight will continue to grow.

Watching “Flying, the absolute worst thing you can do for the economy” made a few things very clear that I think help to sum up the problem with our current modality of life in “the developed world.” We have reached such a level of luxury and privilege that we cannot imagine or possibly support a system that does not provide us with the same level or increased level of ease and excess aesthetic splendor. I have often heard from my parents that they simply, “want to give me a better life than they had growing up” and for my dad, whose family always struggled to make ends meet, this makes sense. They were lucky to have one car growing up and food on the table. But my mother grew up in white suburbia and rarely wanted for anything. She was supplied with everything society at the time suggested she needed to live a happy fulfilled life. She had her own room, her own car, nice new clothes, color tv, all the bells and whistles. And yet, my mother is extremely discontent and is constantly in the middle of some new project that requires mass levels of consumption like remodeling the entire house, revamping her wardrobe, planning a massive, multi-leg flight dependent vacation, or any number of other projects. They always seem to occupy her for a month or two at a time, and with each purchase she seems to feel the same high she is constantly chasing. But ultimately, as is the way with fast fashion and much of our consumer marketplace today, the project comes to an end and she is once again faced with the insatiable desire to consume. 
     <br><Br>


So if her end goal is to provide a better life than her own for my brother and I, and any future generations to come, then it should follow that such a society must consume at an unprecedented rate to keep up with this high consumption standard of living that the previous generations have bred us into. We know no different, this is the world we were born into. But this life of luxury that we all lead is obviously not the same as those being lived by the majority of the world. As Ken stated, only 5% of the world population has ever been on an airplane, a luxury many of us take for granted. This luxury that we are so used to is just now becoming the norm for China and has yet to emerge as a remote possibility for the majority of the world’s population in countries we would deem “less developed” than the United States. But if we are really so developed and so well equipped to transport large numbers of individuals via air travel, then there is absolutely nothing stopping us from putting money towards a more energy efficient mode of transportation: high speed rail.

     <br><Br>

During the post war era, the automobile industry boomed and Americans raced to buy their first car. The decades of development that followed, as Ken has covered, were some of the most innovative years in American history. To support this new advancement, both state and federal governments had to allocate funds into the rapid expansion of new infrastructure to accommodate for the vehicles, evidence of which can be found all around us. If the same excitement and fervor were to surround the concept of high speed rail and bullet trains, I think we could make a dramatic shift in the way most Americans today travel long distances within the continental U.S. But, the corporations and the politicians they have bought have invested great sums of money into the fossil fuel industry, so we still cling to cars despite the numerous benefits of other forms of travel. It will take an active refusal to consume fossil fuels on the part of the consumer for these corporations and government to consider other alternatives not run by fossil fuels. Once they realize that Americans and the rest of the developed world is not going to meet the demand that their excess supply and greed requires, they will have to switch tactics and move into the development of renewables and more environmentally friendly modes of transportation like high speed rail.

I was shocked to hear that 19/20 people will never step foot on an airplane. I am in a big bubble of what I am used to. I would have never thought that 95% of all humans on the earth would never step foot on an airplane. This also means that they will probably never leave their country or definitely their continent. 
     <br><Br>


I think that a lot of the problem with the whole climate crisis theory is that we are not addressing the corporations. Transportation (including Cars, Boats, Airplanes, Cruise Ships) is only 14% of the entire carbon output. I think that we should focus on the government and foreign governments that need to put a cap on carbon output and put a major carbon tax. I do not understand why the vegan and vegetarian diet are not a bigger part of this course. Not only is it extremely healthy, but it also saves the lives of billions of animals. It would also end the majority of deforestation, carbon, and methane.

Before watching this lecture video, I did not know that there would be an option to go to places like New York by train. It would be time consuming, but it could still be an option. This video is shocking, considering that I do want to travel, but it's nice to know alternatives such as taking one big vacation as Ken mentioned. Something that came to my mind when I rewatched this video was the song "Glamorous." I honestly did not know that even flying first class can release twice the amount of the emission of a flight from LA to Paris.

When discussing the video from last week on cars in class Ken said, if I didn’t already lose you by telling you to give up your car, I’ll probably lose you next week when we talk about air travel. The first time I watched this lecture video, I thought Ken was right and that he did lose me. I was ashamed to admit this but my selfish interest to explore the world and learn about all of the beauty and culture that exists away from my everyday life at first won out.  But, I couldn’t get that feeling of shame to go away and I realized it stemmed from the hypocrisy of my above statement.  That is I said I wanted to travel so that I could see all of the beauty that this world has to offer, and in doing so, I would be destroying that very beauty and that very planet that I claimed was the reason for my unwillingness to give up air travel.

     <br><Br>

Another interesting aspect of this video was the point about a cultural transition to slow food.  This hit home with me because I love nothing more than spending hours cooking a big meal each night and sharing it with my friends and family. In fact, the process of making the food is always what I look forward to more than the product of the food itself. I thought this analogy was very effective in describing the benefits of slow travel as well as proving that such a movement could succeed. 

     <br><Br>

In the spirit of honesty and full disclosure, I do not see myself cutting the privilege of air travel out of my life completely for journeys to other continents, but I will certainly think twice about how I travel across and explore within the United States as well as how often my journeys around the globe occur.

It's great that you're going to think carefully about how you travel! I find it rather shocking that some people don't even notice the effect their actions have on the environment. I can count on hand how many times I've flown in an airplane, but I've only lived for about two decades, so I expect that number to double or triple. Yet, some people will fly more than my lifetime of flying, now and in the future, in a week. I've heard stories about people who live in two places and have to fly between them frequently, and their carbon footprint scares me. Also, California is so big that even in-state students might fly, not to mention out-of-state or international students.
     <br><Br>
I feel that humans are great at destroying stuff. So many ants have died under our feet, not to mention how we're in the sixth extinction due to humans. I still remember Ken saying that it'd be better for nature and the wilderness if we actually didn't go seek it and try to live in the forest or something. When something is running out or about to disappear, most people will instinctively try to grab it. If they had a choice of preserving it or having something rare and one-of-a-kind, most people would choose to have it, as seen from people stealing from monuments or other special locations. If they can't have it, then they'll at least try to take a picture of it. That's pretty much climate tourism. Since it's going to disappear anyway, why not rush to see it? People give up on saving the environment because it's much more easy to book a ticket on a cruise and see the last gasp than to rescue what they think is about to die. It's a shame that most people would want to see endangered areas and species instead of saving them, which will let them be seen for years and years. 
     <br><Br>
 Flying is a great invention and we should take advantage of it, but it's sad that people overuse it frivolously. It's even worse when people have to overuse it for business or family.



<br><Hr>
I agree with almost everything you said. I was also quite lost with Ken suggesting we give up air travel. I could consider switching to public transportation- sort of- and definitely dietary changes, but this seems so unrealistic. A big part of my aspirations for life have to do with seeing the rest of the world and travelling within my work. I suppose one could argue that there won't be a life to live if we don't stop polluting but again, this seems so far out to be realistic. Similarly to you, I can't necessarily see cutting out international air travel either, and I will try to cut out domestic flights but there are issues with that as well. The biggest problem I can see is that once we join the work force, we will only have so much time off of work per year. Therefore to maximize vacation time, flights seem to be the only realistic choice if you have a specific destination in mind. On the other side of your comment, I found Ken's comments about slow food to be quite interesting. In considering this, I realized how little slow food I actually eat. Most of my consumption- especially now at college- is pre-made snacks that require zero preparation, and eating out at cheap fast food restaurants. This, I look forward to changing next year when I have regular access to a kitchen.

After seeing Ken’s lecture on air travel, I honestly was not surprised. Airplanes consume massive amounts of fuel just to go from point A to B, as efficiency is sacrificed for speed in the sense of travel. Growing up, me and my family have always been frequent flyers, usually to travel the world or to visit family in a different state. During these times, my parents always reminded me that flying to see other parts of the world was a blessing, as many others wouldn’t have the chance to see or do what I was doing. 
     <br><Br>
Thinking back on that to now, air travel has always been to more od luxury rather than a necessity. Yea, getting to Phoenix from LA in under an hour rather driving for 6 sounds nice, but is it worth the money and the carbon footprint? Making the drive is cheaper and more ecological; so what if it takes longer?

“80% of all flights are made just by 1% of the people on the planet”.  I never realized that there are still so many people who haven't flown before knowing that the professor introduced in the video.  As an international student, I have to return to China twice a year, which means that I have consumed several times my carbon footprint this year. Such a large carbon footprint makes other environmental efforts ineffective.Compared to taking a plane, going back by boat seems more inefficient and expensive. It takes five times the price and fifteen times the time to return to China by boat. Efficiency does not conflict with environmental protection. A carbon tax may be a solution. When the cost of carbon emissions increases, the amount of carbon emitted by people will decrease, as will the number of people who develop environmentally friendly energy and technology to make money. However, the United States will not levy a carbon emission tax, because this will make the United States less competitive in the international market. Unless most countries do this.
     <br><Br>
Slow travel is also a very comfortable way to travel. Compared to going to many places but just taking pictures, slow travel can better understand the culture of a place and relax more.

Before watching this video, I knew that flying was bad for the environment, but I did not know how absolutely detrimental it is.  This information made me a bit disappointed; I love traveling and have a strong desire to explore south-eastern Asia.  Even though I would go to backpack and thus have a very low carbon footprint while there, the travel would emit close to the amount of co2 allocated to an individual for several years.  While this has a huge impact on the environment, it does not make me want to reduce my traveling.  This past summer, I was in Europe for a month.  During this time, my main form of transportation was trains and other forms of public transportation, but even with this, the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted throughout my adventure were probably close to an ideal individual’s co2 emissions for 3 years.  

     <br><Br>

Although I care about the environment, I do not want to stop exploring places of the world that are not easily accessible.  This makes me question my stance as an environmentalist; while I do not each much meat, shop secondhand, and avoid purchasing one time use items, I can't imagine giving up on traveling.  I definitely try to reduce my carbon footprint in my overall lifestyle, but staying away from planes is something I am not sure I can do well.  It is unfortunate that there is no train between Santa Barbara and Nepal.

Watching this lecture video, was extremely eye-opening, because I am at cross between to things, my love for traveling or the well-being of this planet. I’ll admit I am the type of person to catch a flight instead of driving somewhere only because the flight time will be shorter than me being in a car. I truly never understand how horrible that was until I started taking this class, I have done a lot of air traveling in the span of my 18 years on this planet and honestly a lot of those plane rides could’ve been replaced with taking a train or even by driving to be honest. My whole problem here is I really want to travel all around the world, but at the same time I don’t want to keep adding to the damage to this planet, plus I am pretty sure my carbon footprint is large enough already. But Ken is right life is about the journey not the destination.
     <br><Br>

But to answer the question is time to remove air travel out of our lives, I would say yes and no, because although slow travel is more environmentally safe than air travel, there is still question of how would people who live in different countries across the ocean who want to come visit their families. Yea they could take a ship, but a transatlantic cruise is way more expensive than hoping on a flight from L.A to Paris.

Like you, I do fly every so often because my family loves to travel. I did not think that being able to afford flying made my family a part of the “1% global elite”, because by American standards we are just a middle class income family. It puts into perspective that Americans really are harming the planet more than most other nations, and it has just become a part of our normal life. It makes me kind of sad because my family works so hard to be environmentally friendly. My parents always recycle and compost their waste. Rarely anything is thrown in the actual garbage can at my house. They always encourage my siblings and I to bike and walk when we are going to friends houses instead of driving. They also raised us to use limited water and electricity in order to be less wasteful, and don’t eat red meat. Yet, by travelling by plane at least once a year, our carbon footprint is already so large compared to families in different countries. It seems that it doesn’t matter what changes we have made to our daily lives, we are still harming the environment by travelling to different countries.

After watching Ken’s video about flying, I had several thoughts regarding this problem. Nowadays, flying is one of the most common ways to travel around the world. It can save a lot of time and let passengers get to their destination quickly and safely. Before watching this video, I truly did not know some huge impacts that flying will bring to our planet. In order to diminish the effects, people ought to try fly less and take train or bus more. However, it is somewhat difficult for students, especially international students. As an international student, I often go back to China during Christmas Holiday and Summer Holiday. It will take around 13-14 hours to fly to China and same amount of time to fly back. Of course, we can not choose other transportation to go back to our home. It is inevitable to fly several times during a school year. Besides, I appreciate other ways that we can choose to go out. If we only want to travel in the United States, we can take trains rather than domestic flights. We can see beautiful scenes along our way. It is also relaxing and comfortable although it takes longer. Therefore, I believe that we should take public transportation such as train, buses, and subways more frequently if possible. For most people, it is kind of impossible for them not to fly anymore. For international students, we need to take plane to go back to our home, but everyone should have an awareness of this issue and its consequences in our mind.

At first, I wasn't interested much in this video when hearing that flying only contributes 2% of all greenhouse gases, but after hearing the following information after this statistic, I was left feeling like I should barely ever fly again. It was crazy to find out that a flight from LA to Paris can release 3 tons of CO2. This is ridiculous as according to the Paris agreement, each person should only contribute 2 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere yearly. Just by making this flight, you are already using 1.5 years worth of your personal CO2 impact. Flying first class? Then you are using twice this amount. One simple first class flight can cost you 6 tons of CO2. 
     <br><Br>

This is a huge problem as when you multiply this by all individuals who fly, you will get a crazy number of CO2 that is released back into the atmosphere. Another fact that shocked me was that 19/20 people have never been on a plane. 80% of all flights are done by just 1% of the population. They are known as the "Jet set."

I feel that a lot of people have experienced feelings of discouragement after hearing watching and listening to this lecture. Even though flying contributes 2 percent of greenhouse emissions, one flight has the ability to  multiply one’s climate impact by 2-3%. It almost feels worthless to even attempt to minimize one’s carbon footprint by consuming less meat products or taking bus and train instead of driving, knowing that all of this is relatively insignificant if we take a flight across country. I think this video can serve as a warning in a way, to what we as a society are facing in terms of industrialization. 80 percent of all flights have been taken by one percent of the population and 19/20 people on Earth have not been on a plane. There was once a time where only the wealthiest and most developed countries were able to reap the economic benefits of industrialization and automation without placing high regards for the environment. As the effects of global warming and climate change are becoming more visible, developed countries are placing extensive amounts on countries who are just now getting their own wheels turning. With flying, only a select few of the most privileged humans around the world are able to fly, many of whom do so without taking the environmental toll of flying into account. One day, flying can possibly be more accessible to the populations who currently do not fly. Are we going to wait for everyone’s carbon impact to multiply by 3 percent, in order to regulate flying? Flying contributes to only 2 percent of global greenhouse emissions, but this number can easily skyrocket if more people had the means to fly. 
     <br><Br>
Many of us can not easily give up flying, whether it's due to attending school out of state or other types of obligations which require flying. No matter how insignificant it may feel, collective action can ultimately leave to widespread change so I believe that it's important for us to monitor our over consumption. If you must fly, consider taking economy instead of first class. The seats are bigger in first and business class, which makes less room for economy seats.  Relating to Ken’s lecture, less people are then moved for the same amount of fuel, making first class a less efficient flying option. Some options to travel seem unimaginable, such as riding an electric bay to a destination over 300 miles away, for a span of three days in which you explore and stay the night at different Air Bnb’s. Though more environmentally friendly, there is privilege in this option as well that is not  contained by many people. The problems that we are facing, along with its solutions, meet a crossroads of privilege and accessibility. I think we have to figure out how these different solutions can be manipulated to be used by a range of communities.

Never before would I have drawn a connection between climate change and air travel. While watching the lecture video I was surprised to hear that air travel was the most destructive form of transportation that people use. When flying you are a direct contribution to the climate crisis at a rapid rate which furthermore doubles and triples your current carbon footprint. 
      <br><Br>
However, there are alternatives to air travel such as using technological devices to connect two people who are apart from each other which would be motivation from traveling to visit this other person. Another solution is the slow travel movement which consists of a traveler cutting their travel plans into sections of different forms of transportation. As discussed in the video, you book a bus on a train ride to get from point A to point B, and from B you can take an airplane to point C, although flying is not the best choice when traveling, doing the slow travel movement would cut the overall contribution of greenhouses gases by half. The final choice would be to decrease the frequency or stop flying altogether.
     <br><Br>
 Although these options are manageable, I don't think they are realistic for our society. Our society undoubtedly moves at a fast paste thus I highly doubt that the slow travel movement would ever become popular. Therefore, I believe that in order to promote these alternative choices than flying, we have to engineer faster moving trains. If society is able to improve public transportation to appeal to the modern person, I would argue that there is a chance where people stop flying as regularly and perhaps driving as well.

I found this to be a fact that was very hard to confront. I have flown a lot in my eighteen years of life and I have been grateful for the opportunity to do so. I have visited family, I have traveled abroad to do volunteer work, I have traveled for vacations with my family. I like to think that my plant based diet and reasonable environmental choices are making an impact, but now I realize that my lifestyle and eating habits are meaningless when I take into account the amount of carbon I have put into the atmosphere by flying.

Jet setting is something seen as a goal in American culture, traveling around the world and posting it all on Instagram has become a trend within the millennial generation. I’ve always seen travel as an escape from day to day life and traveling to the ends of the earth seemed like a refreshing experience. It's heartbreaking to know that if I want to be environmentally conscious I will have to give up those dreams. American vacation policy does not allow for slow travel as an option for many people. The  average vacation in corporate America is two weeks. With slow travel, you couldn’t get very far in those two short weeks of respite. Culturally, if we want to invest in slow travel, we need to prolong the average number of vacation days in America. Already, Europeans have many more vacation days than we do, not to mention better infrastructure when it comes to slow travel. Ironically, better infrastructure and longer vacations are the opposite of the workaholic and jetsetting American mindset, but environmental awareness will be after all, primarily a cultural change.

I made a point on your lecture video about cars last week referring to the disastrous/deleterious effects of the aviation industry. It is a serious problem that is plaguing international travel -- however, I don't think the solution to the problem is outright looking for other modes of transportation. I have family across the country that I feel obligated to see and connect with, something that a simple facetime call can't solve. So traveling by train across the country will take 2 maybe 3 days of travel out of the already limited amount of time that I have. We don't all have our summers completely free to do as we want. 
     <br><Br>

Once again, the solutions that you propose are not necessarily feasible for a large number of people who travel continentally or globally is an integral part of their lives. I think a better alternative than reverting back to older methods of transportation is focusing on the technological advancement of planes. We are starting to create electric cars globally, but why has there been no development of electric powered planes? The technology is not there yet, which is obvious, but if we stifle the industry by refusing to fly then we will never have that option. 
     <br><Br>

A more realistic solution is vying for the development of more environmentally friendly planes that will dominate the aviation industry. Otherwise the solution you proposed will not have the global impact that you're hoping it will have.

At the beginning of Ken's video, I didn't expect to learn this much about flying and how bad it is for the world. I was shocked when he said that most flights are made by only 1% of the people on this planet. I would've thought the percentage of people who flew was way larger due to the fact of how frequently people tend to travel. I personally have never been on an airplane before so I didn't feel too guilty like others in the comments did while watching this video. Ken's solution, slow travel, is a good idea but is it practical for everyone?
     <br><Br>
Students who live out of state and even internationally don't really have any other way to get back home other than by plane. I mean yeah they could drive, take a train, or find other ways of transportation but the way that our academic year is set up plays a big part. Between each quarter, we only have a week, or 3 if it's winter break, to go home and see our family and friends. Although I only live 2 hours away from home and tend to go home a decent amount of times, I like to spend as much time as I can when I'm back home. I can only imagine how out of state/country students feel. I'm pretty sure they just want to catch a flight and get home as fast as they can. So, although I understand Ken and how he feels about this issue, I can also see other people's opinion on it and sympathize with them.

After watching Ken's lecture, I realized that air travel is a harmful way to the environment. Most people are unlikely to think about the climate crisis when they chose transportations. So the lectures actually let me think deeply about my lifestyles. As an international student, I could only use air travel to get to school. However, I think what can be improved is to reduce air travel on holidays. Maybe I can take a train instead while traveling to another city in spring break. One of the most surprising facts in the lecture is only five percent of people in the world once traveled on a plane and the small number of people actually brought huge contamination to our climate. Though poor people never live a wasteful way, they undertake the troubles of climate change first. I think it is unfair for them to pay the price of others' mistakes. Thus, when we schedule trips, we should choose more environmental-friendly ways of transportation.

I had believed I hadn’t traveled on a plane much - I think about twice or three times to visit the Philippines - but after watching this video about just how bad flying is for our environment, I realize that even those two or three times emitted way too much CO2 throughout my short life. If 3 tons of CO2 is released in the atmosphere per trip, I’ve already emitted so much CO2 going to the Philippines and then coming back. Of course, I don’t believe there’s an exactly environmentally friendly way to get all the way to there in order to see my extended family, but I still feel a sort of guilt for not knowing just how destructive flying was,
     <br><Br>

I understand some of the sentiments in the comment section about how flying can’t totally be avoided for some people, such as international students who want to go home. However, I believe if it CAN be avoided, then why should we ignore that option? For example, taking overnight trains to get across the country can take too long and be a hassle, but if we really wanted to reduce our emissions, we should take that option over flying if we have the time.

This is actually a very interesting problem for me. One of my grandfathers was a plane mechanic, the other and and my dad worked and work in aerospace, and my uncle works for the FAA. I admire airplanes as incredible feats of engineering and the amazing pieces of machinery they are. I can't help but to love airplanes and what they do, and when Ken said they are the worst way to travel environmentally, I feel somewhat conflicted. Are airplanes now a thing of the past? Will they be apart of the same thought as the generations that caused climate change? I surely hope not. We have the technology to create electric almost anything, maybe the next step is airplanes. At the end of the day, the planet is more valuable than flying, but if air travel was made more expensive, could that help? Maybe a carbon tax? I don't know at this point. As it is, I do not fly a lot, so cutting down vacations would be very possible for me, but I am not sure how receptive other Americans would be to this idea. Just as with consumerism and cars, air travel has a sense of freedom with it that I am not sure many Americans are willing to give up.

In this video, Ken explained the environmental-disastrous feature of flying. According to COP21, we should not emit more than 2 cubic meters CO2 each year. However, if you fly once, you will produce all this amount of CO2. After realizing this fact, I feel very shame for myself. As an international student, I usually fly between my country and United States. Attending this lecture helps me to learn many facts about the situations of the planet and humans. Before, I usually felt angry about groups which harm the environment for their own benefits, such as the fossil fuel corporations. But I did not realize that I also emit so much CO2 footprint. As a result, I decide to reduce my unnecessary flight. 
     <br><Br>
In addition, Ken offered a good solution for business travel. Instead of meeting together, companies can employ the technology called telepresence, which people can see and hear each other from faraway. This is a great idea because it not only protects our environment but also brings convenience to people. We should promote this advanced technology in different fields besides business, such as schools and hospitals.

This video gave me a new perspective on flying. I knew that flying was not good for the planet but I did not know it was absolute worst thing for the environment. I always considered myself a non frequent flyer because I travel by plane a handful of times over the summer, but now I see I am a large culprit of this issue. The statistic that "80% of all flights booked are by 1% of the planet" was so shocking to me. Ken brings up the fact that a lot of people travel for business. This is perplexing to me when we have apps like FaceTime or Skype. These features might not be as personal as in person interactions,  but they still allow for a face to face conversation which is better than wasting carbon emissions to. be somewhere else.
     <br><Br>

I was excited to learn about the train industry. When I am in Europe I frequently use the train however, in the US I rarely do. After hearing about Ken's delightful experience, I am super motivated to try taking the train as a method of traveling. Trains may take longer but if they're helpful in the cutting down of carbon emissions, I think it's worth it. Traveling by train also allows you to have experiences that you would not have on an airplane. The trend of "slow travel" can teach people important lessons about life, which could be another huge selling factor. "Slow travel" allows people to be less consumed with getting places quick, and being on top of the latest product. This movement could further help other areas of the climate crisis because if people experience less urgency, they'll possibly be less likely to feed in consumer culture.

This video was a hard one for me to digest because sadly I am very guilty of overindulging in my carbon emissions when it comes to flying. For a very long time my parents lived in two separate states and so I would fly back and forth for visits very often… I'm sure I exhausted many years worth of my carbon emissions and i'm not proud. It's hard, transportation is tricky and I think this is the sphere people struggle with most when it comes to changing one's behaviors due to climate change. I do like the suggestion of train and bus usage, I think this could be transformative in vacation experiences and our culture. Just because there are faster motives doesn't mean we should routinely opt for them. As of lately I’ve been more considerate of this and in the future I hope to structure my trips in a way that is more environmentally conducive.

The thing that upsets me the most about this topic is the pointless use of private airfare. I do not condone celebrity useage of these facilities and find it not only inconsiderate but a massive detriment to global health.

After I have watched this video, I am shocked by the fact that flying has generated an enormous amount of carbon to the environment. Despite the pollution plane has generated, I don’t think that we can eliminate the use of airplanes. By far, it is the fastest and most convenient way in which we can travel from one country to another. Although business travelers can try eliminating the use of planes by organizing online meetings, international students can not avoid traveling by airplanes. Telepresence can never replace meeting one in person. Unless we can discover a new alternative to travel quickly, I don’t think the use of planes can be eliminated.
     <br><Br>

Nonetheless, slowing traveling can help to alleviate the extensive use of air travel. In this case, alternate transportation methods must be inexpensive, reliable and enjoyable in order to ensure customer satisfaction and encourage travelers to reduce flying.

I agree that it is a difficult issue because flying is just unavoidable most of the times. International students don't really have a choice if they are flying across the ocean. We really need to build a well-designed rail system throughout the United States to at least reduce the carbon emissions from flights within the US, and it's already a much more inexpensive option than flying. The only thing is it just takes a long time, but hopefully the benefits of rail transportation become more known to the public and will encourage travelers to utilize it.

It never really occurred to me that flying could be so detrimental and such a large influence on our yearly carbon emission. Usually, the emphasis is put onto smaller forms of transportation, like cars, but this just shows how unaware the average consumer is about the things that contribute to their carbon footprint. Although I don’t fly on a normal/frequent occasion, it is quite astonishing to consider that a single round-trip from plane to Japan over the summer has significantly contributed to my annual carbon footprint. Assuming I emit similar amounts of carbon to the average American, I likely used somewhere around ¼ my annual footprint in a 24 hour span. This is genuinely concerning, considering the increasingly large amount of private jets/planes that are appearing on the market in the modern era. If technology continues to progress the way it has been for the past century, I would not be surprised if small planes become a common occurrence.

This lecture video gave me a feeling of being hopeless for the climate crisis. Unlike other lifestyle changes that Ken brought up that are reasonable, avoiding travelling via airplane is not feasible. As a student from Maryland who goes to school here, air travel is the only viable solution for travelling and I am sure it must be the same for a great amount of air travellers. I think air travel is so infrequent that people just don’t care about reducing it.
     <br><Br>


I must admit I was very surprised when Ken revealed the statistic that only 1 in 20 people occasionally flies and 1 in 100 frequently flies. This put the 2% yearly emission thing more in perspective.

     <br><Br>

However as the world gets wealthier, more people will inevitably travel via airplanes. This talking point really doesn’t give me much more to say then it is what it is.

I am completely shocked by this lecture video! I had no idea that flying emitted so much CO2 and increased my carbon footprint so drastically. Personally I don't fly very often, my first time on a plane was actually last year. Flying is convenient and fast; for these reasons, it is a very popular mode of transportation, especially for those who can afford it. I completely support taking trains and other modes of transportation over flying, but sometimes it simply isn't reasonable for certain lifestyles. In this video, Ken mentions telepresencing for business travel. I support this idea because it is extremely practical with the technology that exists today and wouldn't require flying. It would not be the same as an in person meeting, but ultimately it gets the job done and like Ken mentioned, would prevent unnecessary CO2 emission. To answer Ken's question at the very end, it is difficult to match flying. Like I mentioned, flying is currently the most efficient way of traveling great distances quickly and easily. I am no engineer, but I would like to see airplanes modified in some way to reduce the CO2 emissions, if that is even possible. This video will make me think more carefully next time that I plan to take a flight. It is moments like these where I am so appreciative that I am taking this class because I have learned of my ignorance.

After I watch the lecture video, I get a better knowledge of the impact of air travel that I haven’t thought regarding the climate change impact. According to the video, the people who travel by air are the most privileged people, and nineteen out of twenty never been on an airplane. I’m surprised that a single long air journey can double or triple a personal carbon footprint. Besides, there are two types of air travel, business, and recreational travels. The solution is to consolidate as much as possible, which people can travel by train or bike to their destination. Slow food, slow travel, and slow fashion have been a rising strategy to reduce personal carbon footprint. 
     <br><Br>


However, personally, as an international student, I can’t reduce my air travel. I believe that air travel is an essential transportation that connects the global and even culture. For long-distance travel, I think that people would not have any other choice other than flying. The airline will not cancel the flight because of not enough people travel to one place because there is always going to be traveler willing to travel. My personal choice to not take the plane will not affect much. There is not much you can do with air travel, and sometimes the solution is not applicable.

This also changed my view of air travel. I knew that air travel wasn't super good for the environment, but I didn't know that it was as bad as Ken talked about. I also didn't know that 95% of people haven't been in an airplane before, which goes to show the limited and skewed demographic I interact with, since most of the people I know have been in an airplane before. First class, which is meant to give more comfort to flyers and bring in more money for the airline, in my opinion either shouldn't exist or the enhancement to normal flying should be dramatically reduced. Flying in an airplane already significantly increases our carbon footprint, and flying first class doubles it. Since you mentioned that you are an international student, I completely empathize with your need to actually fly because without air travel, there would be no way to reach the US. Also, air travel significantly reduces travel time, which is so much more convenient for people. I agree with your statement that air travel, although it can be reduced, is very difficult to actually control and this is one of the situations that we can't do much about it.

I have always seen flying as the most convenient and environmental-friendly way of traveling but this video has completely changed my mind. Ken mentioned that flying not only emits carbon dioxide but also other greenhouse gases like mono nitrogen oxide. Flying is indeed considered as an iconic display of privilege according to Ken. People always see flying as the way of showing social status. People sitting in the first class are regarded as the elite of the society. This concept towards flying is somehow a twisted ideology. With the fact that early 50% of Americans have never set in the plane in United States, whether flying is the best way of traveling when enlarge the scope to the overall population is debatable.
     <br><Br>
I personally thought flying is the most time-saving and cozy way to go from one place to another. However, after watching this video I started to think whether this long-time kept belief is right. It's true that flying saves time, costs more, and provides people with better services. But are those things truly valuable? We are taking advantage of the development of technology while putting burden on our earth. We are doubling and even tripling our carbon footprint by flying. 
     <br><Br>
Consider other ways to travel like train, bus, boat and etc. They cost more time, but taking them isn't less interesting. Spending more time during the travel process is as valuable as getting to the destination in time. 
     <br><Br>
I'm really considering to decrease my flying times per year and turn to other ways of traveling. I'm sure spending more time on the way is a great life experience and it helps to protect the planet at the same time.

In this video, Ken brought up both flying for business purposes and recreational flying. I am sad to say that my family members, as well as myself, have done great amounts of both types, and this alone likely makes our carbon footprints astronomically huge. My parents are both tour guides. They take clients onto tour buses and show them various places. In the case of my mom, she takes people to see places all around the western and central United States such as Denver, Yellowstone National Park, Mount Rushmore, Arches National Park, etc. My dad only does local tours in California now, but for a number of years he actually did grand international tours that included Los Angeles, Las Vegas, cities in China, New York City, Vancouver, Toronto, etc. As a result, both of my parents have flown around an extraordinary amount. My sister and I were both born in New York City. We moved to Los Angeles over a decade ago, but since then we’ve both made multiple trips back to New York to see family and friends. To have Ken so blatantly, and rightfully, call frequent fliers out in this video really made me ashamed, as if this class hasn’t shamed and depressed me enough! 

     <br><Br>

I love the idea of ‘slow travel’ for both its beneficial environmental impact and its sort of romantic (in the sense of romanticism) implications. I agree with Ken: it would be a nice way to spend your day relaxing and watching the California coast go by. And it would be a hell of a lot better for the environment than flying. However: in a previous video, the one about the film “The True Cost,” I said that fast fashion is just too affordable for the vast majority of consumers to give up in favor of more environmentally friendly and ethical clothing products, that are almost always far more expensive. That idea can be modified to fit the issue of flying, as well. Almost always, if you’re flying to a place, it’s because it would take way too long to get there otherwise. Plane tickets are definitely not the cheapest thing in the world, but they cut back on the travel time dramatically. And as the old saying goes, ‘time is money’. Tell the businessman who frequently needs to go on far-away business trips for his company that he needs to re-evaluate his way of traveling, and he’d chide you for wasting his time. People who take flights as part of their jobs literally have no time to explore alternative methods of travel. 

     <br><Br>

It probably sounds like I’m being extremely critical of the video and Ken’s suggestions but I’m really not trying to be. I agree that flying is horrible for the environment, and we should strive to find other options that will hurt our planet less. It’s just that unfortunately, the truth is that currently, in this modern age, it would be extraordinarily difficult to get a significant amount of people to change their flying ways to mitigate the impact it has on the environment. Still, at the risk of repeating myself, it is something we should strive for: it’s better to try than to do nothing at all.

Because I’m from China and my family is in China, flying back and forth seems inevitable to me. So, I’m wondering what else I can do. Well, because I don’t have a car, I always have to decide between taking a bus and sharing a Uber with my friends when I leave from SB to LAX. While taking a UBER seems little bit more private and comfortable, taking a bus is more economically smart. After listening to this lecture, I would definitely choose to take public bus in the future because it releases less CO2 than car does.

It is crazy to me that I had no idea how destructive plane travel is for the environment. It seems obvious now but I had never considered it a top issue because it is only responsible for 2% of co2 emissions. I failed to consider the disproportionate nature of plane travel; if more people could afford and access air travel then this would be an incredibly prominent factor of environmental degradation. I was very shocked to hear that 19/20 people on Earth have never stepped foot on a plane. 
     <br><Br>
This realization made me feel guilty because I have taken many flights in my life, both recreationally and for soccer games across the country, without ever thinking about the damage I was doing to the environment. This is particularly frustrating for me because I have made many recent changes to limit my footprint including switching to a predominantly plant based diet and trying to consume products more sustainably. Unfortunately, all of these positive changes are going to be erased by my family's trip to Europe for spring break. It is wild to me that one or two days of plane travel could nullify all the positive changes I have made in recent weeks. It really does make me want to limit my plane travel. I am very open to the idea of cutting parts of plane travel that could be replaced by train or bus. I think that offers a potentially more enriching experience in that it places equal emphasis on the journey as it does the destination. As far as business travel goes, I think telepresence is a realistic solution to limiting plane travel. I think most business interactions can adequately be simulated with technology assisted communication. I think the experience of recreational travel can not truly be simulated but business meetings definitely can. I was especially blown away by the fact that one could expend their entire co2 emission allocated for a year and a half in just a couple hours of plane travel. I do wonder if there are any advances in technology that reduces the co2 emissions of planes. I know that that effort is kind of futile for cars because it is far more efficient to just reduce car usage but the experience of plane travel seems much harder to replace. I think that it would be a better use of resources to develop more efficient planes rather than cars.

Flying honestly is something that I have never given much thought towards in the past when it comes to causes of climate change until I began following influencers on instagram. Every other post when you view the pages of these incredibly wealthy people is typically a glamorous image of someone sitting comfortably on a private jet taking yet another luxury trip to a new location only to jet off to somewhere new literally the next week or so. I understand that flying is a necessity for many people who may have extended family across the globe who have no other means of getting there but I find the fact that rich people use planes to travel all over the world without thinking about the ramifications of that much emission to be absolutely inexcusable. I recall seeing a post where a celebrity used a private jet solely to fly a couple hundred miles away and pick up a meal before jetting back home all in one night (I think it was a Kardashian most likely), and seeing that truly made my blood boil. These people would rather release an incredible amount of CO2 into the atmosphere for something as simple as food as if it were the same thing as walking over to another block without thinking of the ramifications of their actions upon the planet, and it is incredible irresponsible of them. I truly hope we have limitations on things like private jets or at least taxation upon private air transport in the future so the rest of us don't have to pay the price for their actions.

I just feel weird when I read this paper. I have been just told to not drive a car frequently, eat less meat, have fewer cosmetics and just living in a lifestyle of Minimalism. But is it really such important? Though it is true that these productions will harm you environmentally friendly society. but there is still a lot of people who will not follow the rules. Then doesn’t that will be unfair for me to live in a less comfortable ways than others. By following these traditions, will there be any different from the undeveloped countries people with us? less food, more veggies, fewer cosmetics, no flight trip…
      <br><Br>

As an international student, I have to have round flight trip twice a year to come back to China. Therefore, if I just follow your suggestion to save the 3tons Carbon dioxide for every trip. I will freak out… though it is true that all of the materials in English 23 are all suggestions to protect the environment. What is more, everyone includes me loves the environment they live with the environment directly all the time. Even just a sign in life will produce CO2 to the atmosphere as well. But all I want to say is that instead of suggestion, what we should do directly to protect and save the environmental resource is to restrict the public by setting law. 
     <br><Br>

Personally, as a Chinese, I think my country did a great job of protecting the environment. We set the birth control since 1990 just to decrease the population gradually. To not only reduce the competition on limited natural and social resources but also decrease the consumption on every side. What is more, we also set the law on limiting driving. We set rules on the plate numbers. The people who end with algebra numbers must not drive in the even days and the people whose plate numbers end with letters cannot drive in the odds days. Consequently, that is one of the reasons that Chins is developing positively these years. Thus, maybe setting rules is a better option instead of having suggestions to everyone and only a few people will follow it and some of them will also reluctantly follow the rules (just like me)

This lecture was very enlightening in regards to understanding the true impacts of flying.  Though it would seem obvious that flying is a huge polluter and is one of the worst things someone can do from an environmental perspective, many of the statistics provided by Ken amazed me.  For example, the fact that 19/20 people have never flown in a plane is crazy to think about, because of how nonchalant and normal it feels to our culture here. During the holiday season, it is common to hear people talking about taking a flight to see their family or go on a vacation.  Much like the problems with using private cars as a mode of transportation, the societal view of airplane flying is so ordinary that it is hard to forget that not many people have the same opportunities like us. But, though it would be amazing for everyone to have the same possibilities and ease of travel, we need to be moving towards other modes of transportation.  Like Ken said, not only do 95% of people not have access or have never travelled by plane, but planes account for 2% of global greenhouse gases.  That doesn’t seem so bad, right? This is wrong, because if more people were to fly, that percentage would skyrocket (literally).  Instead, we need to focus on new modes of transportation or evading having to travel altogether.  
      <br><Br>
I really enjoyed hearing about the idea of slow travel movement.  Selfishly, I have been wanting to take a trip across the country by train as well, purely for the views and the experience.  But imagine if instead I were to use that trip by train in lieu of another vacation or travel to see my family -- it would reduce my emissions and give me a chance to enjoy my time on the road!  Using technology is also the answer here, in the idea of telepresensing.  By using apps like facetime, google duo, or even machines like facebook portal (which can follow you as you move around the room) can reduce the amount of business trips by plane.  This not only benefits the environment, but also the employer that would have to pay much less to send their employee on an airplane.

I believe that like slow eating, slow travel never really went out of style. Roadtrips may not be as environmentally conscious as taking a bike, but they're definitely better than flying cross country, and they have always been a favorite of mine. I've always loved road trips in our camper van. I also recommend camping to spark a love of nature, which can spark a love for the environment. I would love to take a biking vacation with friends (time to start a Pinterest board...) and I genuinely think I would enjoy it more than flying somewhere. Planes are cramped and the air in them is stale. Bikes are fun, I love the wind and a view. (Oh and can you imagine the Instagram bait)
      <br><Br>
Cooking slowly has always been a favorite hobby of mine. Even things that are easily bought, like pizzas, are so much better homemade, and the mundane action of creation is a small act of therapy. It's odd how things that are better for the environment are often better for you and you're mental health as well. It's almost as if we evolved to fill a role in the environment, not grow past it.
      <br><Br>

My home is in the Bay Area, which some may think necessitates a flight from Santa Barbara, but I've never found that to be the case. There's a train station in Goleta and a bus that leaves right from UCSB. It's easy, cheaper, and a heck of a lot better for the environment. Plus, the view of the ocean from the train is so very nice!

I feel conflicted after watching this lecture on flying in airplanes. Flying is a detriment to the environment, yet there are few ways to travel across continents, which are pretty much only by plane or boat. Flying is a much more popular avenue of travel because of the speed of it, yet by doing so we wreak havoc on the environment. It is a problematic predicament because there is no real replacement for flying besides just not traveling, yet that is fairly impractical for many people. 
      <br><Br>

One of the solutions brought up by Ken is the idea of slow traveling, yet it is not a completely suitable alternative because it is nearly impossible to fit into many people’s tight schedules. Time is a luxury, and many people will likely not be swayed due to how much more of it is wasted when a more convenient option exists. A theoretical solution then would be a carbon tax imposed on all airplanes, yet this has its own impracticalities and detractors, not making it an end-all be-all solution either. Whatever ends up happening, flying will most likely continue to pollute at an ever greater rate than it is currently as more and more people gain the luxury to fly.

On this week’s block, Ken talks about the environmental impact airplanes have on the world. It was astonishing to learn that airplanes are only responsible of 2% to 2.5% of all the global greenhouse gasses. I always thought it had a higher percentage as there are many flights on a day. I just was in awe to learn this. Ken also introduced an incredibly approach for this problem, and that is to use alternative methods of transportation to get to the places we want. You might be wondering on how to get to those places that are overseas, well think no more! We could significantly reduce our CO2 emissions by doing such a small thing as changing the way we get to places. Taking the train for example is a viable option. While this trip might take more hours than just taking the plane, you could visit places that you had never seen before, and have a good time with your family. Not only does this solve the environmental issue but also helps us to get close to those we love. By doing this, we also reduce the times we fly. Yes, flying is a commodity but isn’t it better to spend more time with your family and yourself? We live in a society that wants everything right away. We don’t like to wait. We are so impatient that anything that takes time makes us angry. In order to reduce the amount of times we travel, we have to convince ourselves that not everything has to be done right away. If we fix this, then we don’t have the necessity to continuously travel by airplanes because it takes less time. Let’s use technology as a tool to improve our quality of life rather than destroying it.

This video does make me uncomfortable, as Professor Hiltner predicted. Flying around the globe and exploring is a life goal of mine. I would hope to be able to travel a lot and spend a decent portion of my life abroad. So, it is with great sadness that I watched this video. I really strive to minimize my footprint, flying is an expense I had always disregarded. Unfortunately, our planet can not afford this luxury, as widespread as it has become.
      <br><Br>

Perhaps I could travel a bit more over land, and trying to travel via bus and train, as is very common in places like Europe. So, recreational air travel isn't necessary but it is an expense many take for the sake of time.

After watching this video, I took a whole day to think about what the video proposed. To be honest, this is a topic that is not really something that privileged California students want to hear or talk about. We are the group of people that are the privileged population that are contributing to the 2% of greenhouse gasses produced by plains. We are the privileged class that can take steps to reduce our footprint in many fashions such as switching to a plant based diet, eliminating plastic, buying mostly second hand clothing, but when it comes to eliminating the ease of how we get somewhere we want to eliminate from our thoughts. It is almost as if denying the facts makes it not exist. There is a parallel here and between the climate change deniers. Climate change deniers ignore all the facts of climate change because honestly, they don’t want to admit its true and impact their life. I think much like we would tell climate change deniers we need to inform people, especially the privileged that get to fly how much of an impact that they are having on the planet. 
          <br><Br>
     I had a conversation with my housemate after I watched this video and I explained how bad flying and driving were for the environment. My housemate is a very environmentally friendly person who really tires to reduce her impact by not eating meat or diary, limiting her plastic consumption and more. However, when I brought up the issue of not driving of flying and eliminating consumption, she started to get defensive. Her arguments were not very valid. She tried to justify herself and actions, and I acted as devil’s advocate. I explained to her how we could use mass transport instead of flying and how we should only be buying items that bring us happiness and joy. It was an interesting conversation to have with someone who seems environmentally friendly. It was as if when she had to sacrifice her own needs and desires, she was no longer in. The conversation ended with her saying, “I know I should bike to the store, but I’m not going to.”….. 
         <br><Br>
      I think that this is a problem across the board. For example, Santa Barbara country is one of the county’s that supports the environmental movement the most, but when it really comes down to making steps towards that goals the county has been far below reaching those goals. What I am asking is how do we change that? How do we get people to step outside themselves and think more about how our daily actions are impacting the planet? Once we are able to do this I think that we can really combat issues such as cars and planes being the primary mode of travel for most privileged American people.

What is the alternative to flying, though? The invention of planes and air travel has revolutionized the way we go to far-away places. Sure, we can take the train or drive, but will many people be willing to take the time to even do that? It's very tough to move people away from flying, especially those that fly frequently. I just don't see any other alternative that is as timely and convenient.  

         <br><Br>

While I believe that there are little to no alternatives to flying in terms of travel time and convenience, I do think that people could make adjustments to where they don't need to fly. Like Ken said, instead of flying to a conference to give a talk, people could just video conference.

I didn’t realize how much air-traveling contributes to the emission of the greenhouse gases before I watched the video. I also didn’t know that air-travel can be doubling or tripling someone’s personal climate footprint. I agree with the solutions proposed by professor. As someone who loves traveling and fly across continents more than five times per year, I think the most feasible solution for long-distance traveling is just to fly less. For relatively short distances, I’ve tried using the trains and the rides were actually quite enjoyable.

Flying is also a problem for me as I am an out of state student and have a lot of family members that live on the other side of the US also. I was inspired by Ken's video to make sure that I sort of run through a check list for flying. Firstly, is taking the trip necessary? If I do not need to be there person I can just facetime or call or something else of the like. Secondly, if the trip is necessary, what means do I have to get there? If I have access to alternate means such as taking the train (which I can do to go home!) my plan is to do so. 
         <br><Br>

I think that flying is normally not the first thing to come to mind in terms of what can be done at the individual level environmentally, so I am glad that Ken brought this point up. After a little thought, I believe that flying can be avoided in a lot of cases or at least greatly reduced and saved for special occasions. Ken's mentioning of enjoying the journey was inspiring too. Sure, not flying might take longer, but I think that more can be seen and done along the way, which is more appealing in the long run.

When the issue is analyzed from every angle, you can discover that the reason why flying has become such a mainstream mode of transportation is due to one reason: convenience. As modern society evolves, people tend to take the easiest route in almost every aspect of their lives, no matter how environmentally harmful those behaviors may be. If humans were to revert their convenient-seeking behaviors to a standard that was held to about fifty years ago, the average climate footprint would drop dramatically.
         <br><Br>


But if we want to talk about realistic solutions, I'd say the most practical one would be to have everybody fly coach. That means no first class, no business class, and definitely no private flying. Flying to a desired location should not be done unless it were to be deemed absolutely necessary: for instance, spending just a few extra hours on a train can not only help cut down carbon emissions from traveling, but can also help people realize that the journey is far more important than the destination.

         <br><Br>

It's hard to imagine a world where more than just 5% of the world's population flies on a semi-regular basis. If we're doing this much damage to the climate by flying, imagine what would happen if 100% of all people on the planet were flying. The end would come much sooner than it already is. People must learn to undertake and enjoy slow travel, as they would realize not only are they still getting to their ultimate destination, but they will learn to enjoy the journeys that they will take.

I agree that convenience and selfishness are often the main factors in people choosing environmentally-detrimental behaviors over lower-footprint ones, but I also think in our economy and work culture, these harmful behaviors are often essential. For someone who wants to see their family on the east coast over Thanksgiving break for example, or someone who wants to visit family abroad for a couple weeks, time constraints imposed by work and school make it essential to use fast travel options instead of slow travel. In the same way that developing hybrid/electric cars is better than not developing them at all (at least in my opinion) because people will still be using them for convenience despite their high carbon footprint, I agree the most realistic option is mitigating our negative impact by doing things such as flying coach instead of more expensive and detrimental options. 


         <br><Br>

I also find it shocking how much our planet would suffer if more people flew semi-regularly, and I'm surprised that so few people seem to know how intense the negative impacts of flying are on the environment. I personally considered myself relatively environmentally conscious, and knew flying was bad for the environment, but had no clue my international trips had such an impact on my carbon footprint.

When I began watching the lecture, I thought to myself, how else am I going to fulfill my aspirations of global travelling? Yes, there are cars, but cars can only take you so far, and are huge factors towards global temperature increase. When Ken stated the alternative of trains instead of car use, I completely agreed with him. The first time I went on a train to travel was when I went to visit my family last quarter. I thought it was going to be a dreadful, crammed experience, but it was actually the opposite. I personally enjoyed the trip there and back to Santa Barbara, and would not mind having to travel by train from now on. It is scenic, I don’t have to worry about driving/keeping my eyes on the road, and can work on homework or whatever I choose to do. Yes, trains are slow. However, this lack of efficiency does not even compare to the the burden air travel has on the earth. Like stated in the lecture, one 24-hour flight emits three tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Imagine the countless flights during that same time around the world, and the fact that the people travelling most likely have a ticket back to where they originally flew from. This statistic is scary and horrible to hear, considering how many people view air travel as the best form of travel and reaching far destinations. Most travelers do not consider the problematic side of flying, and see it as a luxury and a blessing, or at least that is how I viewed it until taking this course.

Yee I really resonated with your comment! I feel like things like trains and buses are super underrated. Either that or people just choose to ignore those options; I know i've done the same and honestly all it takes is just spreading the word and opening up the idea. That's one part of the video I found intriguing was Ken's  idea of an individualistic way of approaching climate change, because it's an idea people don't even think about. The amount of difference you can make in yourself and the environment by choosing not to fly on a plane is immense; 3+ metric tons of CO2 emissions is no small amount. It won't be easy for me to hop of the plane route of travel, but it's definitely going to make me think twice about ever flying back up to the bay area back home. But whether it's one plane flight, or one pound of beef I am truly beginning to feel empowered at the amount of individual impact I can have against climate change. 
         <br><Br>

 Ken's point about "slow travel" reminded me of a family roadtrip I took to texas when I was about 10. Instead of flying, my Dad was keen on driving the journey instead. Of course this would still prove harmful for the environment, but it made me appreciate that idea of the journey over the destination sentiment as a kid. To this day, it's one of my favorite family road trips from my childhood (despite being stuffed in the back of the car).


<br><hr>
When I began the lecture video, I thought the same thing as you: How am I going to fulfill my aspirations of global travel? I honestly always thought that air travel was better for the environment than other forms of travel because its transporting more people than a car and its so much quicker so there’s less time to emit a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere. I now see that I was very incorrect. I agree with you and Ken in that there are many alternatives to travel by planes within the US (or even Canada and South America), but how will we be able to get to other parts of the world that aren’t drivable? I am studying abroad next fall in Madrid and I could not be more excited to go, but I am now concerned about how much CO2 I will be emitting.. A good thing is I won’t have a car there so most of my transportation will be public transportation, but I am still emitting more than I should in my round trip of travel than I should be in over a year. I agree with you that train travel isn’t as bad as it sounds, you sit back relax and enjoy the ride. It’s hard for me, personally, because I am not from California so every time I want to go home for break it only makes sense to fly because since I’m only home for such a limited amount of time I want to make the best of it. I feel guilty about how much I travel to and from Colorado and would like to cut it down but it seems unrealistic for me. I wish they had created a type of speedy train transportation that could get you from coast to coast in under a day. Hopefully one day we can direct our concerns on improving public transportation and in turn reducing the amount of CO2 emitted from various types of transportation.

<br><hr>
I found myself relating to many aspects of your comment. Most prominently, I also always thought of flying as a cool luxury way of travel that is very time efficient. However, I never really did consider it's CO2 emissions when compared to other methods of travel. Although I do find the way that Ken and others tend to glorify the train system as luxurious and relaxing to be a bit excessive at times, it really is a good travel alternative for several reasons. Traveling by train is not only a more environmentally conscientious , but is also far cheaper. I had a similar experience traveling back home by train to visit family, and was ultimately forced to take a train because it was the option most affordable for me. Ultimately, I guess the point that I'm trying to make here is that although transit options such as train and bus are not always the most comfortable or time efficient, they should still be utilized for the sheer environmental benefits alone. As environmentally educated individuals, I believe it is our part to help out whenever and wherever we can. Consequently, I think making some of these decisions in the name of the environment will help us slow down and truly reflect on the important aspects of life, instead of always worrying about our material wealth or social image.
<br><hr>
I had quite a similar reaction to you following this lecture on why air travel is causing the most harm to the environment. I too have always had a dream of traveling the world through the ease of air travel—easily hopping from one city to the next. I got to live part of this reality during my study abroad experience which I now feel almost ashamed about. When preparing to study abroad I held so many fantasies of traveling somewhere new each weekend when I had a whole city at my fingertips, ready to explore. People I met through classes also had these same fantasies and quickly began searching for the cheapest, fastest method of travel which typically was done through flying on an airline such as EasyJet or Ryanair. Many of these airlines have a reputation of delayed flights so I tried to steer clear but nonetheless was still participating in this mass dumping of CO2. As Ken mentioned in this video and you have also pointed out in your comment, traveling by train is such a great option when traveling and many times a more enjoyable route! Before I was able to drive, I used to take the train into New York City from my town all the way at the end of Long Island. The train was a more reliable option than any form of transportation on roads since traffic was always an issue when entering Manhattan. When I moved to Santa Barbara I also started utilizing the train for travel to LA, and the views are gorgeous!

As someone who is a frequent flyer, I have to say that I would hesitate to reconsider flying for more environmentally friendly options simply because of the inconvenience. As mention by Ken in the previous lecture, a car is a personal burden to the extent that it’s less safe while constantly costing money. However, compared to a car, a plane is safe and fast, two of the most important things that I consider for methods of travel. Similar to the shortcomings of public transport, alternatives for planes are slower, less safe, more straight up less desirable. Speaking in terms of opportunity cost, I feel like avoiding planes is a less viable path for many frequent flyers. Someone could give up driving and pay less while being safer. Someone giving up a meat diet will live more sustainable with minimal additional costs. However, traveling far distances without a plane costs time, effort, and convenience. With most of my recent travels being over long distances, I can’t imagine traveling the same distance without a plane. While I recognize that slow travel can be a more enjoyable and meaningful trip in addition to being more environmentally sustainable, I don’t see how that can become a viable option in today's world. I can certainly consider slow travel for leisure trips with family or friends but that not what the majority of my trips consists of. My last plane trip, I took a day off school to fly from Florida to Houston and back in one day to take care of my visa. Without a plane, that would not be possible.

I am a bit conflicted with this lecture. I was unaware of the complete gravity of flying and its effects on the environment. I do not fly often at all in fact I haven't flown anywhere in many years. Yet as I grow up I would love to travel and explore new places. The problem arises with how exactly to do that when flying is so terrible. I believe travel is important to growth and general acceptance of new cultures and places. Of course I could drive places instead of flying but then I am taking way more time to do anything. If you fly, it is much faster and you have more time to enjoy the place you get to. Of course I love road trips, but I do not have the availability now or most likely in the future to take large chunks of time off to travel.I am unsure however if gasoline and a long road trip would be equally as bad as a flight. Trains are handy as well but not as versatile for movement when you need to go multiple places. I now understand that flying is terrible and I should avoid it as much as possible if not completely. I am curious in future years if we will find ways to minimize the effects of fling on the climate.

I was one of those people that had never stepped foot onto an airplane until I was 17 and had to visit my mother in Japan for the first time ever. Having family who lives 16 hours away from you on the other side of the planet makes it hard to not take a plane. Especially when the flight is completely over the Pacific ocean, there's no way you can split up that flight into smaller sections and take trains for part of it because it's literally just water between us. It would be hard for me not to fly out to Japan to see my family, but honestly I only fly out every few years to visit my family over there. Like its just not practical to take a boat from California to Japan because it would literally take so long, and I have limited time to be travelling. The only solution I can see would be to never visit Japan which just isn't an option for me because I couldn't do that to my mother and sisters. It really does make me feel guilty when I step onto a plane though because I know the environmental impact is tremendous, but it's just hard to see a way around it when you have family halfway across the world. However, if I need to go somewhere in the US I would preferably take a train or something else to get to my destination. Who knows it might be a cool trip, and its less impact on the environment.

After
watching the lecture video “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do
environmentally”, I get to know that flying emits 3 tons of carbon dioxide per
person. And professor Ken proposed suggestions for people who take flights. For
business people and visitors for recreational purposes, he advises that we can
fly less and travel grand traveling every five years. I have a question here
if we really want to travel to near countries like Japan or Korea, we have to
take a flight because there is no train or buses to go there or we cannot
travel there. Taking a flight is the fastest way for us to have a 7-day
traveling with limited time. My parents need to work and they cannot have a
longer vacation than 10 days. Also, what if we really want to take a traveling
and it is not like consumption for clothes. I admit that it is true that we can
take trains or ships and I will if the transportation is available for me. 
         <br><Br>




Also, telepresence

like skype and facetime or WeChat help us to communicate with videos and
images. Though communication through telephone or videos emits less CO2, I
believe I prefer face to face communication because in this way, I can feel
their existence and I can touch them. This is a cultural challenge for most people
I think. Then, Ken suggests a slow food. I totally agree with the point. Slow
food is much slower than buying chips at KFC but cooking for yourself gives a
sense of life and safety. You live and work for yourself and you can feel happy
being with your family during cooking time. Simple and environmentally friendly
brings innocent and naïve joy to you.

After watching the video, I learned that although only 2% of the total greenhouse gases are emitted by air travel, I didn't expect that making a plane would increase my personal climate footprint by two to three times. And every time I travel by air, I will bring two times of damage to the environment. Personally, I don't like flying, although the reason is that flying brings me physical discomfort. Now after watching this video, I understand the harm of flying to the environment, and I will reduce the number of flights.

I agree! Flying was never something that I thought would be the greatest part of my carbon footprint but now I see flying much different. Flying has always been a pleasure, something I look forward to, something I am grateful for but it has become apparent that it has serious environmental impacts. I think that flying is something many of us take for granted along with driving and I believe we should begin to consider sustainable alternatives to flying and driving.

I would consider myself a frequent flyer. I fly to Hawaii about 4 times a year to visit my family, which is about 2,400 miles each way. I love to travel and hearing that this is one of the worst ways I contribute to climate change makes me very sad. How else would I be able to see my family that lives across the ocean? Ken mentioned trains across the ocean? How would that even be possible? I guess I sound pretty selfish but I just can't imagine not being able to see my family. But then I also hear the statistics about how 24 hours of flying contributes 3 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere meaning that if I fly to see my family 4 times a year, 5 1/2 hours each way, that's almost 6 tons of CO2 I put into the atmosphere every year JUST FROM FLYING. If slow travel was an option for me (price and destination wise) I would definitely consider it. I think even more people would consider going by train across country if we had the super fast bullet trains like china has! Also, if these options were cheaper than flying, more people would pick the eco friendly way! I do understand that I am very lucky to have the opportunity to be able to fly in the first place but I honestly don't feel like I am "elite". Maybe that's because I've grown up in a town where many people travel often? I hope one day we can make traveling not only more eco friendly, but available to more people because its really a life changing experience.

While I believe completely writing out air travel would be a great response to the climate crisis, it simply is not probable. Slow travel, while more environmentally friendly, is not an option for many travelers. The purpose of airplanes is to travel great distances in a short amount of time. Some travelers need to get to where they are flying to as soon as possible, while many others cannot afford to take the extra time off so they can participate in slow traveling instead of flying. Slow travel can add days to a trip. That is extra time off work that many do not have the luxury of taking off. Although it is unrealistic for very long distances, I believe slow travel should be adopted when traveling shorter distances and when one can afford to take the extra time.

Wow, and my dream was to travel the world. Yet most likely by the time that I have the time and money to do it there will not be much to travel due to climate change. It was not a shock to me that flying affected Earth and cintributed such a big percentage of greenhouse gasses. It just sucks. I was not aware about the fact that only 5% of the world is responsible for air travel. I myself am a part of this percentage. I used to air ttravel at least once a year before I started high school. Now I do not do it as often. I thought I was safe to say that I was not as guilty due to the fact that I reduced the times that I travel or own my own privtate jet as celebraties do.  However I am still guilty. In my opinion celebraties and rich people should be fined if they use their privtae jets for dumb or short distances. They are the main ones contributing as they travel regularly and not by bus or train since they can afford to have their own private jet.

 In 2019 I rode a train for the first time and I found it pretty cool, and  so did my friends. I encourage others who travel home for long weekends or breaks to do so also. Not only is it fun but you are contributing less to your carbon footprint.

I too had dreams of traveling the world. Yet after watching this video and knowing the cost, it would have on the environment would be incredibly selfish of me. Although an airplane cuts down on travel time it is also cutting down on the time we, as a species, have on living on a habitable planet.

Ken’s anecdote of the slow travel through does interest me. There are SO MANY cities in California alone that I have not stopped to appreciate. If I were to do the e-bike travel and get to know the cities between Norcal and Socal stopping at the air b-n-bs along the way. I might have to try that one day.

I too have always considered traveling the world and experiencing all that life has to offer to be a dream. However, with the knowledge that I would be contributing such a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, I'm not so sure that it is such a good idea. listening to prof. Ken's lecture on air travel has me feeling somewhat guilty about my past flights. to know that I am disproportionately contributing to the end of our planet isn't exactly a great feeling. One problem for me at least, is that if we all decide to commute by slower means, we could reduce emissions, but for travel across continents I don't think the majority of people commuting would take slow transport. Most consumers are impatient (myself included) and will likely chose to take a flight across the Atlantic or other destinations due to the time commitment that slow travel poses. As far as I can see, reducing our personal flights, while not adding more gases to the atmosphere, doesn't solve the problem of the general public's transportation.

I can say that I’m one of the people on this Earth who has never been on an airplane. I consider it a privilege that many can not afford and only the rich have access to private helicopters and jets. Even with all the advantages, flying gives, it also contributes to global warming by 2%. Now that may not seem like a lot, but it totals up and over the years it will be much more. Imagine if helicopters became as popular as cars and everyone who can afford a car got a helicopter instead. We will no longer see street traffic, but rather air traffic. The people who ride airplanes are wealthy and its crazy that air travel can double or triple your carbon footprint. As shown in the previous videos about other methods of transportation, there are ways to reduce the co2 level, but I sadly doubt people will do them. It would be very time consuming for people to bike to their destination indeed of flying. There’s also one big difference and its that one would involve physical movement while the other one allows you to rest and simply wait to arrive. If I were to travel from Califonia to New York I would clearly not want to take a train, but if it was California to Oregon, I would still think about it and may choose to take an airplane to get to my destination in a quicker time frame.

While I understand Ken's point to reduce flying in order to help the environment as well by traveling slower. Road trips are a great solution to this as it allows you to see parts of places that you would normally fly over. Every  year my brother and my dad would drive to his college in Ohio and each year they would take a different route to school which I thought was cool and a good alternative to flying. Some problems I saw with choosing not to fly was for one, time. For some people, their job requires them to fly around a lot and driving would make those things obsolete as it would take too much time. For others it's a matter of life and death as air travel means bringing people to hospitals faster or delivering medicine to plague driven areas that need it badly.

I never realized how environmentally costly taking a flight is. Over the summer I took the exact flight Ken mentioned, LAX to Paris. That flight was absolutely miserable, but this is coming from someone who doesn’t like long flights. I also didn’t realize how many people have never traveled by plane. A flight, in my opinion, isn’t some extravagant luxury. I feel as though I’ve seen people from all classes on planes. The statistics that only one and twenty people have traveled by plane was crazy to me. Most of the people I know have flown on a plane but now I realize it’s because I live in an affluent country where people have the privileges to fly. 
          <br><Br>

Since a large amount of my family lives on the east coast (i.e. Maryland, Boston, and Florida) I often travel by plane to go visit them. The way I see it, it’s more bearable to fly for five hours than to drive for five days. Not only that but it would be less expensive. I’m not trying to promote flying in any way shape or form. I think flights are just convenient for traveling long distances. If anything people who travel short distances for business by using airplanes could use trains or cars. 
         <br><Br>

Over the summer, a couple of years ago, my friends and I traveled by train and we had a great time. I’d prefer to travel by train, especially after learning it is 20x better than taking a flight. Another great thing that people are doing is ride sharing. A couple of months ago I wanted to go visit my friend at UCLA and I was looking into trains, then buses, but my roommate told me about this ride share app. People who were driving to LA posted their trip and people who wanted to go that same direction would contact the driver and pay to go with them. I was able to find someone who was driving to LA and traveled with her. Carpooling, I think, is a great way to travel and reduce emissions.

I thought this lecture was very informative and eye opening.  I did not know that flying was the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally. I have flown about 10 times in my life, and have never really thought of how bad for the environment it was. I also would have never thought that flying first class contributed twice as much CO2 as the coach.  I think the personal approach issue makes a lot of sense. When Ken brought up the people using private airplanes, and how terrible it was, it made me question why I have always seen it as a luxury or something that I have always wanted to do.  I also have never thought of flying as a privilege, and was extremely shocked to see that 19/20 people in the world have never been on an airplane. I found Ken's ideas interesting. I think having one grand vacation every five years instead of one vacation a year wouldn't be bad. I also never had thought of traveling on a train, and then taking an airplane rather than just taking a straight through flight. The Slow Travel Movement was interesting to hear about but isn't very ideal. Time is very important to a lot of people and they may not be able to afford to spend that much time traveling like with work or school or other responsibilities.  I think we could reduce our air travel when it is for recreation and business. Maybe like a limit on how much people can go per year. I also think private flying should be completely eliminated unless it is for an emergency.

This video was a hard one for me. I'm in a long distance relationship; for the next few years, my partner lives in Ohio, and the only way I can see them in person is by plane. As much as I see the potential to enjoy slow vacations and want to reduce my footprint by choosing local and healthy travel when I have the option, none of those solutions solve the issue of being able to hug the love of my life.

My friend's dad moved to Hong Kong when he was 12 because his job required him to. My Grandpa moved from Malaysia to England to Seattle for the same reason. If you're an independent businessperson who can make your own decisions about travel, reducing your environmental footprint this way makes sense. If you're an employee, it doesn't seem so viable. Would you risk losing your job, your ability to support your family, over this principle?


         <br><Br>

I think that an unspoken cost of reducing air travel are these situations, the ones where sacrificing flight means sacrificing family, or your ability to support your family. Of course not every situation is like this, I'm choosing to reduce my personal flying vacations dramatically as a result of this class. But I think it's helpful to have a nuanced conversation here, and acknowledge that sometimes the cost of not flying is incredibly personally high.

I 100% agree, I was especially uncomfortable when Ken stated, "We expend an enormous amount of energy transporting our bodies around... when just seeing and hearing each other would do". In some cases: yes, seeing and hearing each other is enough to make my time worthwhile, especially since I am 6 hours away from my friends, my family, and my boyfriend. But the sense of needing to go place to place because of the type of job you have, is almost impossible to work around. My job WILL require me to have face-to-face conversation and events, my job WILL require me to take flights to different countries so I can properly do research and meet people who know the culture, and my job will be in the film industry.

Of course, I am actually part of the majority that has NEVER been on a plane, mostly because of financial issues and my mom being afraid of flying in general. But I am soon going to be an employee that needs to travel to different countries and states quickly because the business requires me to do so. However, I really love the idea of "slow travel" and my mom and I really want to try it out this coming break by using the train more often (especially since it is more cheaper both time and money compared to her picking me up from UCSB and going 6 hours back home, for her being 12 hour travel). So, if it is just travel within the U.S., "slow travel" is possible and more suitable.
         <br><Br>


But when it comes to going overseas, I don't think "slow travel" and needing to heavily remove flying is an option. If we applied "slow travel" with overseas, it would mean taking a train to a port, then going on a boat to go to the next port. Both boat and airplanes are heavily unhealthy for the environment, from how I see it with Ken talking about cruise ships being very damaging to the environment, so what will be the difference? I honestly think that there is a giant issue with this when it comes to overseas traveling and I am not sure if we can figure out a way to reduce a lot of flying because of 1) overseas flying and 2) many businesses requiring us to take flying to be successful.

Like you, I am also part of the majority that has never stepped foot on a plane, so I felt is easy to understand what Ken was saying. After reading some comments, I saw that there were some situations, like yours, where I felt air travel as necessary. Even though the cost of air travel is so high, I do recognize that reducing air travel can come across as impractical or seem like a personal sacrifice. And in some cases, it absolutely can be both of these. But I find that we can look at this issue through different lenses. As Ken has told us many times, the climate crisis is also a cultural problem. Instead of looking at reduced air travel as a hindrance, first let us look at the reasons for needing it in the first place. The example of your job is a great way to start. As a culture, maybe we should reduce traveling for business reasons and instead start implementing more telepresence technology in the workplace.

I come from a family of pilots. But I had never truly and in depth thought about what the ramifications of this type of lifestyle was. However, I worked at an aerospace firm this summer as a sustainability intern and this is when I realized how much carbon we truly emit through air travel. But it’s not just the part where we actually use air travel where the problem lies. We talked about it with cars, but the manufacturing of airplanes (and spaceships) requires so much more CO2 than a car would. 
         <br><Br>

When I worked in the aerospace hangar this summer, another thing that was brought to my attention was how much CO2 we also have to use in production and manufacturing, not only assembly and use. The production of materials that are strong enough to burst through the atmosphere and withstand the vacuum of space need to be produced under specific conditions - requiring that the facility is a specific temperature and a huge size. I bring this up because it is where our future is headed, we have always aimed for the skies. 
         <br><Br>

The thing is that the cost of flying has not been publicized. It is not commonly known that flying is so extremely bad for the environment and here again is where we have to take a look at what we idealize. But it also brings me to the question of - would flying be a better alternative to everyone having cars because it is ultimately a form of public transportation? And how do we communicate that while it is a form of public transportation, it is really damaging to the environment.

With the development of technology, air travel becomes more and more accessible and more and more people are able to get on airplanes. This is what I used to believe before I watch this lecture. When I notice that 95% people have never took an airplane and only 1% people are frequent flyers, I was surprised since I once saw a picture of air route over the world, which is really complex. Moreover, I couldn’t imagine that air travel under 24 hours can emits 3 tons of CO, which costs 1.5 year of CO2 emission based on the rule that each person can annually emit no more than about 2 metric tons of CO2 or equivalent gases in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°- 2.0 C. As an international student who has to fly frequently for study, what I can do for our climate is to stop flying first class, which emits twice the amount of carbon dioxide into the upper atmosphere. 
         <br><Br>

Besides, I agree with Ken’s suggestion of slow flying and slow travel movement, which means break travel into parts and enjoy each piece of travel in a slow motion. Similar to slow food, slow travel movement is too challenges our original culture status. Yet, as slow food has successfully become a real culture force, I believe it will be the same case for slow travel movement in the near future. On the other hand, as Ken mentioned that transition to slow travel will negatively air travel industry’s benefit, it indicates that it will be a hard process to make such change since those companies in this industry will try their best to protect their own benefit without considering and caring our planet.

I never knew that I was so entitled. How is it that only so few people have flown. This genuinely astonished me and made me feel like kind of an asshole. I am an exchange student and in this year abroad I flew in form the Netherlands. Although it is for study purposes I still consider this a pleasure trip. If I would have known the real impact flying had I would have thought longer about choosing a destination that wouldn't require me flying. Not because I feel flying should not be done at all but because I would say I do not get to choose how the earth ends up for other people. In other words I try not to take part in practices that other people are not able to do, that have a negative influence on the environment.

Growing up, airports have always been a magical place to me,  the way you can move thousands of miles across the world in a reasonable enough amount of time was amazing to me.  How did we come so far in technology to be able to transport people so far around the world?  I realize now that I’m older that these airports are enormous sites for CO2 and mononitrogen oxide gas emissions that contribute to 2% of the world’s GHG.  While this number may not seem very large in the grand scheme of things being the climate crisis, it should be addressed that much of this 2% is being caused by the same group of people, wealthy and privileged people who can afford to be on multiple flights to travel the world.  The glamourized idea of being a “jet-setter” needs to be diminished and in its place, a more accurate picture of greatly contributing to our deteriorating environment should be painted for society.

I had no idea that this movement was tied to the slow food movement. I spent 6 months in Europe last year learning about the slow food movement and had the privilege of meeting many of the founders of the movement. The slow food movement was founded in 1989 in Italy as a response to the opening of a McDonalds, and the ever increasing globalized society where speed reigns champion. The movement set out with the intention of redefining how we eat, making our habits good, clean and fair. In doing this, it meant that our practices needed to be sustainable, local and fair to the workers. Many people in Europe are proud members of this movement and I found its presence far more active than in america. I now absolutely see how flying ties into this criteria. It is both unsustainable and an unnecessary luxury that the only the richest citizens of the world are able to exercise.

After viewing this lecture I feel very guilty for the amount of flights I’ve taken in the past few years. Living in northern california, my parents buy me flights home from school so that they don’t have to come pick me up and so that I don’t have to worry about finding a ride back. It being such an extremely short flight, I didn’t feel all that bad but, now it feels so wrong knowing that the train is right there. I think what makes it so hard to resist things like flying or driving is that it’s so quick, which is a terrible excuse. Sitting in a car for 6+ hours does not sound like a fun way to spend a day but, now that I know the effects of flying I feel responsible at least for increasing my carbon footprint in one of the worst ways I could’ve. 
          <br><Br>
 Hearing about the slow travel movement is quite fascinating, maybe it’s just the pessimistic side of me but, I think it’s going to take a long time to convince people to cut back on flying. It’s a large part of people’s jobs and everyone loves to travel. That being said, it is a luxury. Knowing only 1 out of 10 people will ever step foot on a plane, goes to show maybe it’s just a problem that countries like the U.S need to tackle. I hope as a nation we’re able to cut back soon because it does add to the carbon dioxide problem extremely fast.

I also take flights to Norther California due to convenience .  While it is a shame that it causes so much environmental damage, the flight is going to happen anyway, and saving at least 17 hours of travel seems worth it.  Once I can bring a car to school then I would be fine switching because it would be less expensive and better for the environment, but currently flying proves to be the most efficient use of my parents and my time. 
         <br><Br>


I also laughed when Ken started talking about biking to San Francisco.  In the case of travel, it is not about the journey it is about the destination.  Actually, in all my time traveling, I don't think I have ever enjoyed the act of traveling more than the destination.  If the point of the trip is to be a bike tour of the California coast, then yes it sounds like a wonderful vacation, but in any other sense it is unrealistic and a bad idea.  While I say this, I believe slow travel is good.  I think we should move to a rent-transportation model such as citi bikes, zip cars, lime scooters,  paired with planes, trains, and buses for long distance travel.  We should also move to having all of these modes of transportation switched to being electric powered,  and fund a change in our electric grid to being nuclear and renewable energy powered.  This will allow us to greatly improve our effect on the environment when it comes to transportation.

Ken's explanation on the environmental destruction caused from flying really shocked me. I fly a lot and love to go on trips with my family to different places, however I had no idea that flying caused 150% of my years carbon footprint in a single flight. I realized how privileged I was to be able to fly as much as I do and I had no idea that 95% of the population and never been on a flight. I realize that many friends have ever been on a plane even in america in the 21st century. As my family and I enjoy our flights and travel to interest places, we are killign the earth with our carbon output and affecting the poorest people in the world with our hobbies. It is literally destroying the homes of millions and creating a vast amount of refugees who have no place to live because of the rising sea levels. Not only that but also killing countless animals and the oceans sea life as we acidify the oceans with our CO2. I am fairly conflicted as this was the way of life for me. I may find it difficult to cut this portion of travel out of my life, however I believe that it would be a better way to lower humanities carbon emission.

As someone who travels multiple times a year, I was looking forward to watching this video. I was surprised to hear that nineteen out of twenty people have never set foot on an airplane and that flying only contributes to two percent of total greenhouse emissions. What was devastating for me to hear was how my fondness for traveling has impacted the environment. It is astonishing to me that a round trip from Los Angeles to Paris gives off three metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when the Paris Accords tell us that we should emit two metric tons in a single year. One plane ride already caps your emission and more!
          <br><Br>
I was happy to hear Ken speak about the ways that we can travel and still cut down on our emission; however, I think that it will be extremely difficult to convince people that flying less, breaking traveling into parts, telepresencing, or slow travel are the way to go. I admire the creative ideas, but people like traveling too much. None of these suggestions are an efficient way to move from place to place and some do not allow you to participate in the sole reason for traveling: seeing people and places in person. Many people do not have time to bike or sit on a train for three days. 
          <br><Br>

I do believe that if we can implement public transportation that is currently in Europe and Asia into the United States and the rest of the world, people would stop flying. Rather than sit on a train for three days, we could be there in the same amount of hours that it takes to fly, and underwater tunnels would allow us to get from the Los Angeles to Paris without the use of an airplane. The trains in Europe and Asia are clean, efficient, give off less carbon, and are ultimately the way that world needs to go in terms of reducing the emissions of traveling.

as an Asian American who has relatives in Taiwan, I find myself traveling multiple times a year as well on a plane. I completely relate with you when you mentioned how you were very surprised that nineteen out of twenty people have never set foot on an airplane and that flying only contributes to two percent of total greenhouse emissions. I found Ken’s solutions creative and innovative. They are definitely solutions worth considering because they will without a doubt cut greenhouse gas emissions. The problem that you and I both see eye to eye is the fact that it will be very hard to convince people to take on flying less, using facetime, and embracing the slow travel movement. 
           <br><Br>
Flying less is probably the most achievable solution for most people who are in the 1% that fly. I believe that I can also strive to fly less, but when it comes to my obligation to fly back every year to see my relatives, it becomes a conflict within my own psyche. Should value the relatives I have who are still alive and use my time on this Earth to spend time with them? Or should I think more long-term for the future. These conflicts are common and are something that we as individuals have to resolve. 
          <br><Br>
 Telepresence technology is a solution to an extent. I can see how short business meetings on matters that are not very important to a company can be done on facetime, but I do not think it is the same as meeting someone face to face. Human interactions tell a lot more about a person when you are engaging in a conversation or social interactions in reality. 
          <br><Br>
 Finally, I find the slow travel movement the biggest challenge for the public to embrace. This method is simply not going to attract people who value their time to accomplish the things that they want to accomplish. Also, the world is moving at a very fast pace. Even our quarter system in UCs and the tight schedules we pack for our college lives restrict us from embracing the slow travel movement.



<br><hr>

I agree with you that flying less is an achievable solution for the 1%. My dad in particular would rather drive than fly so that we can experience the "scenic route." I am aware that driving is not a great alternative, but for my family, this is the way to get us to fly less. I also agree that telepresence technology is ok for short business meetings or talking to relatives who do not live near you, but it will never be able to replace travelling for people who are looking to experience a new country and culture. Lastly, I agree that people value their time too much to participate in slow travel. Too many people do not have time to travel for three days and there and another three days back when they only ten days off work. 
          <br><Br>

What I really sympathize with is your problem that you and others have with travelling to see their family. People are not going to stop flying especially if their family is involved, and I do not think anyone can blame people for wanting to see their relative face to face.

Coming from a family that travels quite often, I am ashamed of how much air travel affects our carbon footprint. Before this class, I never thought about the environmental consequences because I will simply not educated to do so. Any and all lifestyle choices I made growing up was made without thought or care for the environment. Instead, I focused in on the personal and familial enjoyment/happiness I received from partaking in air travel. I now know that it’s still possible to do both! Ken suggests that instead of taking multiple vacations throughout the year, we can take one large one every five years. I think this is very doable for me and everyone in my life! However, for the people that travel for business, this is much harder. Because people value so much speed and efficiency in their lives today, slow travel would not be a priority. Things must be done, demands must be met, and money must be made. It seems highly unlikely that certain people will stop travelling often because of the environment if they don’t see the effect face on. In addition to this, flying first class is a luxurious experience, but it’s not necessary. What I suggest is reserved larger seats/spaces for people with disabilities or certain special requests. However, private planes and first class are completely unnecessary and we should try to move away from this.

This video was eye-opening to me.  First off I had no clue that so many people have never set foot in an airplane.  I knew I was privileged to live in the United States and be well off enough to afford vacations and trips that required flying but I had no idea to what extent.  The second piece of information that shocked me was that airplanes were the worst that we could do to the environment.  I thought of it as the same logic as trains and buses because they are carrying hundreds of people it greatly lessens the amount of CO2 each individual is putting into the atmosphere.  This newfound knowledge makes me feel guilty about my traveling history. 
               <br><Br>
     I live about 7 hours away from San Diego which we fly to visit family every year.  I feel ashamed that we unnecessarily fly every year when we could find another method of travel.  We only fly purely out of convenience because " it takes too long " otherwise.  I would like to see if I can convince my family to drive down next year to keep massive amounts of CO2 from coming into the air.  The only thing I cannot come to terms with is not traveling around the world.  I want to experience many other countries and cultures during my life and the only way I am going to be able to do that is by plane.  If I am being 100% honest I won't take the train to New York, I will take a plane.  I will do my best to aware of my carbon footprint while traveling which for me would be to take the train whenever possible, and not fly unless it's a huge inconvenience not to.

To be completely honest, I didn’t think I’d be interested in this video because I don’t fly (never been on a plane actually). However it immediately occured to me that, at some point in my life, I will want to travel overseas and take a plane doing so. I actually liked this video a lot in the aspect that, even though airplanes are not a part of my carbon footprint now, they are definitely going to be later on in my life. I’m glad to know how they affect my footprint now, but I can see how someone would feel very conflicted. I live in LA so I have no problem taking a train or a bus but I can see how difficult it is for people living across the country and especially those who have to travel internationally. Many people can go without having an automobile but in certain circumstances, air travel seems to be a person’s best bet. Because I want to travel as much as possible later in life, I too am conflicted.

               <br><Br>

Because I’m already used to taking the train, I would definitely be all for traveling with that. Trains are cool anyways! I think taking a train definitely adds to the journey while a plane is taken because you just want to get there as soon as possible. I would still probably take a plane to get overseas if I’m being completely honest, but instead of taking flights within let’s say Europe, I would utilize the trains. I think it’s really all about planning and cutting back. I understand the impact, but I don’t see people cutting air travel from their life completely because it is extremely useful in some aspects. However, if we can manage the amount of times we use it, I think it would be pretty great.

It amazed me that although flying only accounts for 2.5 percent of the greenhouse gases, nearly 80 percent of all flights are made by 1 percent of people. For some people working in international companies who really need to take plane frequently, they might really have no choice. However, for some wealthy people who own private jets, I do think they can reduce their flying. When people are not in hurry, taking trains is definitely a better choice than taking planes. I also noticed that the first class will produce twice the greenhouse gases than economic class. Every time I take a plane, I would always see a full loaded first class. Maybe it is about enjoying, but before they choose first class, they should have sometime to consider what would be caused. As Ken mentions in the video, slow food has been gradually more popular than before, and there are some slow travel as well. I hope slow travel will become one of the cultures one day.

Ken's video made me reflect on my own bad habits.  I found it interesting when he states that we must look at the way that each of us individually has an impact on contributing to the climate crisis.  Many of us like to place blame on older generations or major corporations, but don't look to see how we might be causing a negative impact in our atmosphere.  I found it surprising when Ken states that even if one is self-conscious on the way that they are being wasteful, it could all go out the window by flying.  The slow travel movement is an efficient way to cut down the carbon emissions released by flying, but I can see how this might be challenging for people to apply to their own lives.  While it may be difficult, cutting down on our wasteful habits is the only way to stop the clear and present danger of the climate crisis.  Ken's message really stood out to me because instead of viewing flying as harmful, we see it as glamorous.

Yeah, this video definitely hit waaay too close to home. Reading the comments, it’s a lot of defending air travel and trying to find ways to excuse it as “necessary.” Although I am not gonna claim I’m any better - I definitely love the privilege of air travel - it does seem like the only real course that would make any sense is weeding out of pop culture. I’ve definitely sent the Kardashians hate online for their private jets, but I never really stopped to look at my own air travel impact.
<br><br>
It does feel like many parts of circumventing this climate crisis involve being in touch with more human, introspective parts of ourselves. Slow travel would mean people have more time to think and further the sciences and arts. If we don’t spend so much on airplane tickets, we can work less, and take longer on our vacations. The human mind at rest is a truly beautiful and creative thing, and I think our fast paced culture doesn’t put nearly enough value in that.

According to the data which provided in the video, I realize specifically the high amount of greenhouse gases emitted by traveling by plane. Ken also mentioned the problem of flying in Eng 22. I now understand why we need to reduce the times we fly because one plane travel emitted two tons of greenhouse gases which is thousands of times of car emission. I agree that we should avoid to take a plane as much as we can. Instead, we are able to take trains to have a long distance trip. It sounds reasonable and nice to enjoy the views as if we can plenty of time. But in most of cases people do not have much time to spend on the way as they have business. Short distance trips can be avoided to take a plane, but for long distance trips flying might is the only way. Flying, including overseas flying, can not be replaced because it has many advantages and no advanced transportation or technology have the same ability with it. In order to reduce the number of flying, developing new technology for the similar function or purpose is significant. For example, as Ken mentioned in the video, we have a strong network that we can communicate with others face to face through video calls. It is a good way since a lot of companies and individuals are doing in that way. Having meeting online saves people's a lot of time and money which cost on flying. But it has a disadvantage is people can only see what the screen shows. Families want to see the members person to person; businessmen want to see a company in detail. They have to move themselves through flying if long distance. But how to suggest them reduce the times they fly? Developing other transportations which can transport them in fast and convenient way. Trains in US, to be honest, are backward. My experience of taking a train was slow and expensive. As I will suggest is developing the technology on new, high speed transportations and promoting to the public about online communications.

I agree that creating and improving other modes of transportation are a great way in reducing our carbon footprints. Today, flying is the fastest and most convenient form of transportation when crossing long distances. Planes can cross the U.S. in several hours compared to the several days trains take. Most of us also don't have much vacation time so we have to get to our destination quickly. It will be hard to stop relying on planes. Perhaps we can make a really fast train that can cross the United States; however, that would probably cost billions of dollars. I think that communicating with others online is a good alternative even though it can't replace meeting people face to face. I feel like companies should start making more online conferences and video chats instead of having people travel to conferences.

As someone who is one of the few consistent flyers, I can say it’s not because I’m “rich” but because my mom works as a flight attendant for United airlines and I get free tickets. And as much as I hate to admit it, my carbon footprint is probably over triple many others in as I am a consistent flyer of not only far distances but also short distance such as San Francisco to Santa Barbara. The main reason for that is simple, it’s cheaper, and quicker, for me to fly, then to take a train. As a college student trying to save every penny I have, it’s nice knowing I can get a free plane ticket instead of spending the money on a train ticket. I know it’s worse for the environment, but I need the money and I also like to go home to see my family. So having a mom as a flight attendant has not only tripled her carbon footprint, if not more but also tripled my family’s carbon footprint because it’s actually cheaper to fly for us.

<br><br>

Of course, this doesn’t mean I go back and forth to Europe constantly. My family only takes vacations every few years but we constantly travel from one home to another. My sister lives in San Diego, my brother lives in Florida, my parents live in Mendocino county, and I live in Santa Barbara. So as you can imagine, there’s a lot of flying between all five of us. After listening to Ken’s lecture though, it really makes me rethink the way I get home. Knowing the effects of the plane ride makes me wonder if I should start saving up a little extra to just take the train.

<p>
All of the points that Ken made throughout this lecture video were valid and I completely understand where he is coming from when he talks about how we need to transition away from traveling my airplane. I was shocked by the statistic that taking one flight from LA to Paris would use up almost 2 metric tons of carbon which is what one person should be expending throughout an entire year. However, steering away from air travel and towards slow travel is not going to be easy by any means. I have talked about this before but everyone knows that Americans love convenience more than anything. Time is precious and we all lead on very busy lives whether that be because of school, work, extracurriculars, family, friends, etc. For many Americans, slow travel is not appealing because they do not have the extra 8 hours to take the train because of their busy schedule. Say we do stop using airplanes for the sake of our planet. Eventually the air travel industry would go out of business and then we would have a whole new problem on our hands, and that would be unemployment. The airline industry roughly employs 10 million Americans. If people decide to stop flying, all 10 million of those people will become unemployed and will be forced to find new jobs. America already has an unemployment issue and this would just make that issue bigger. I find this to be a very sticky situation and I am not sure what the solution to this problem would be.

My parents consciously made the decision before I was even born that they wanted to raise a well-traveled, cosmopolitan daughter who could feel comfortable in many countries and cultures. As such, I have been visiting countries and places all over the world since before I knew how to talk. Furthermore, as an multiracial individual and someone who has recently moved to America, I also have family, friends, and acquaintances scattered around the globe. While I always considered myself to be extremely lucky to have had these opportunities and experiences, this video has definitely brought a new perspective to it all. 

<br><br>

My first reaction was to cringe away when Ken stated that being a frequent or occasional flyer actually makes me part of a “jet-setting elite” in the world because that statement does not at all align with my worldview or my self-identity. I think it will take me some time to grapple and come to terms with this idea. 

<br><br>

Actually, I never realized that traveling by airplane was the worst thing you can do environmentally. But when Ken stated that one flight from Los Angeles to Paris could take up basically 1.5-3 years of your allotted carbon emissions as outlined by the Paris Agreement, it really puts things in perspective. 

<br><br>

I still feel a bit conflicted because I know that if it weren’t for the airplane, I would not have been able to live some of my most memorable moments nor meet some of the most important people in my life. I think that the person I am today would be quite a bit different since I consider myself, as I’m sure many others do, to have been shaped by certain experiences and traveling to new cultures and places is, to me, one of the most enriching things you can do. In hindsight, it’s ironic that the motto my parents used when traveling is that we were “learning to be citizens of the world” because while we were enriching ourselves culturally, we were also irrevocably damaging the planet simply by traveling to those places. 

<br><br>

In terms of moving forward from here, I think the slow travel movement is intriguing and while it would certainly be a far different journey and experience, that’s not to say that it would not be a fulfilling or rewarding one. As I stated last week, I think an increase in the efficiency of other modes of public transportation, such as high-speed trains, would certainly go a long way to decreasing air and automobile travel on both a personal and social level.

 you provide a very interesting perspective on this topic. First I want to say that I am jealous of you as you have been fortunate enough to see the world. I am a decently traveled person myself but do not consider myself  part of this "jet setting elite". Eventually though I want to become part of this group and experience more of what the world has to offer but after listening to ken speak and learning how flying is the single worst thing I can do for the planet, I question whether my ambitions are ethical or not. I know I am not the only person who wants to do this either, I mean everyone wants to see the world and flying is the most efficient and economically way to do so. 

<br><br>

Our decisions come from how much we care about not only our future but the future generations as well. I wish I could sail around and explore the world, only using the natural energy of wind to take me along but that trip is far more finically and physically difficult. The decision comes down to our own personal agendas, we all only have one life and every day could be our last. Flying is just too efficient and economically friendly especially when we all have so little time to spare between our family lives, social lives and work lives. I like the idea of giant hyper trains but will they be as economically efficient as flying.

I agree with you.  My parents also wanted to raise someone who has seen how big, and diverse, the world is, and wanted me to appreciate all the things that life has given me.  Because of this, my family does a lot of driving to Baja for surf trips, and international travel once a year.  I am also a dual-citizen, and all of my family lives in Brazil, so to visit them there is no other choice than to embark on two 9 hour plane rides.  I also had a weird feeling about being branded a "jet-setting elite" because it also does not align with the way I see myself, or how I interact with the world.  I'm very conflicted about this topic because I know that the places and people I have seen have made me the person I am today, and plane travel has made it possible to see and stay in touch with my family, but it pains me to know how bad it is for the environment.  I think that a lot of people rely on plane travel, whether that is to fly home over the holidays for family or stay in touch with family overseas.  As much as I would like to, I think it would be nearly impossible to take a boat all the way from California to Brazil or drive completely across the country.  I also think that the way to move forward from here is to increase the efficiency of other modes of public transportation because I don't think that you can stop people from traveling.

As a person who travels pretty frequently by airplane, at least two to three times per year, I was taken aback by all the information Ken provided about the realities of my air travel. I had to check my privilege. I had no idea that 19/20 people have never even been on an airplane, and worse that 80% of all flights were made by just 1% of the people on the planet. That sounds insane- a statistic where I am sadly apart of the 1%. Even if globally air travel only accounts to about 2% of carbon emissions, on a personal level, it hurts even worse to hear the impact it has. I do believe that promoting and encouraging other methods of travel would be extremely beneficial to the environment, but more importantly to our experiences. My first train ride from Santa Barbara to the LA area was quite an experience. I had never stared out the window for longer, simply enjoying the view of the ocean and the array of scenery I had never seen before. Yes it was long and at times uncomfortable, but I made a new memory that made it more than worth it. 
<br><br>


Unfortunately, as a 19 year old college student whose parents support me, I do not have much of a say in how I travel. I could definitely suggest taking trains/buses, or splitting between train and air travel to get to our desired destination, but I really do not know how well that conversation would go. I would also suggest taking less frequent, larger trips, but again, as a family that travels very frequently every year I assume this would not go over well. What I can do is push the idea of all the new places and scenery we would experience while also attempting to lessen our carbon emissions. My family and I love to travel so we can experience new places, people, and culture, but that can also be done enroute to our destination through the idea of slow travel. I feel like that it is a more appealing and engaging alternative to just bluntly saying to take a train instead of an airplane. These statistics surprised me more than I anticipated, but I am glad to know so that I can change my traveling methods as best as I can in the future.

Air travel is an extremely convenient option for those who can afford it. I can't think of time effective methods alternate to air travel,  it has such become a large part of travel that difficult to change. It is unrealistic to expect our peers to stop flying completely and to shame them for doing so out of convenience. Time is valuable and unfortunately that has a high cost of increased fossil fuel usage. I hope that one day we can come up with time-efficient alternatives that emit less fossil fuels into the environment.

I agree with your point that time is valuable to pretty much everyone, so our natural affinity of getting where we need to go as fast as possible makes sense. However, despite knowing that there is value in the journey to our destinations whether it be physically, financially, etc. it is challenging to incorporate that in our daily lives. "Life really is about the journey, not the destination." This quote really resonates with me because especially at the time of my life I'm currently in, almost done with college and soon entering the workforce, the main concern that I share with most everyone else is becoming established in my career as quickly as possible. Now, this isn't all bad of a mindset because it provides security and decreases worry about what will happen. However, I find myself losing sight in the glamor of the process getting where I need to go. Given each individual's circumstances, some people have no choice but to only think about the future, especially those in poverty without the certainty of where their next meal, paycheck, or home for the night will come from. But for those privileged enough to not have to worry about that, I would think that they could channel that privilege into enjoying what life has to offer at the present moment. Unfortunately, this is completely opposite to the reality of our society. These people have lost the sense of accomplishment of working towards a goal for a long time and finally achieving it because they can get artificial satisfaction almost instantly with money. What I think needs to be done about this is the glamorization of the steps that lead to this attainment rather than the actual thing or goal itself. This is what will make things like slow fashion and slow travel desirable, however it seems quite unreachable due to our fixation on the quickest solution.

I personally have only been on a plane for a roundtrip to Texas from California only once when I was 12. It was for a family reunion, and besides that I haven’t had any reason to board a plane since then. However, there are many people who have no choice but to travel by plane; such as many out of state college students or those who work far away from their families. There may be trains readily available on the west coast here in California, but they are not as common in other areas of the United States. For example, a student from Georgia attending school in California really does not have the option of transit by train; which leaves them to chose from flying or driving for over 24 hours. 
 <br><br>
For the scenario that a traveler has the option to take a train instead of flying; not only is it more environmentally efficient, but it can even be a nice scenic experience. Train routes along the west coast showcase California’s beautiful beaches, as well as the pacific north west’s green forests. I hope to see more advertisement of both the benefits of the sustainability and wonderful experience of taking a train instead of flying to ones destination, whatever it may be. It is also important to be considerate of those who do not have much of a choice when it comes to flying, but those with that dilema should at the very least take the extra step to fly coach over first class.

After the lecture, I have gained more knowledge about air travel emissions and how bad it really is.  I always knew flying was bad because it's literally in the sky pumping fuel into the atmosphere it's obvious it's bad for the climate crisis.  I thought the business aspect of the video was good and that businesses should go on less vacations and make the ones they do go on very memorable.  I thought the aspect of businesses flying to meetings is dumb because there's literally people flying for their job to do meetings and that is there only responsibility to do for their company is to fly because the others in the company that need to do the meetings do not want to fly so they hire people to go fly out and examine the meetings.  Businesses can just do voice calls and video chat meetings they do not need to hire people to fly out to places to have their meetings for them and report back and almost everyone that has that job of flying for work hates it.  
 <br><br>


However, when it comes to traveling to see the world I think flying is the most effective way time-wise and sometimes even money-wise.  People know how convenient flying is compared to driving or sailing across the sea but it saves so much time.  I do think that many people should try to use airplanes less and travel by another form of transportation instead to help against the climate crisis.  All seriousness aside though when Ken mentioned he was about to take his wife and child to San Francisco on his bike I was dead!!

You make a fair point about how unnecessary "business" flights are. Having a company representative frequently fly back and forth all around the country solely for the sake of being physically present at a meeting is marginally, if at all, more effective than video meetings from a "business" perspective, especially with how advanced live communication technology and digital information sharing is nowadays. Traveling in such a manner and for such purposes is a prime example of how a lot of wealthy people totally abuse the privilege of flying with or without being aware that it doubles/TRIPLES their climate footprint!

 <br><br>

I also agree that the convenience and efficiency of flying for long distances is difficult, if not impossible, to overlook. Incentivizing people to fly less and less frequently with a tax wouldn't be effective, so I think allocating funds to improve long-distance mass transportation as Ken mentioned would be the best shot for deterring more flights in the future.

Being somebody, who as a matter of fact flies more than once per year, perusing the title of this talk alone was sufficient to leave me feeling rather regretful and I was to be straightforward fearing hearing how I've greatly made impediment the planet. I'm even a member of frequent flyer on united.:(  Presently, albeit flying records for 2.5% of the worldwide ozone harming substance discharges, which is not exactly the impact of eating hamburger, it's still amazingly awful for the planet. This video made me upset. I love flying and I love driving. I surmise you could state it is my ignorance, since I do think about the earth. This talk upset me since I found out about how flying for around 24 hours prompts around 3 tons of CO2 to be radiated into the environment and as per the paris atmosphere accords would represent about a year and halfs of one's close to home GHG emanations. 
 <br><br>
A main factor in going through airfare is to eliminate time most intensely. With a lot of our inward framework, voyaging by means of open transportation long separations can be troublesome. For instance, Amtrak's assessment of courses along the east coast, which have been considered in being closed down. Not at all like a ton of what is proposed, as opposed to depending on open framework, I feel an intriguing take is include innovation in doing combating the war we've occupied with against oil from the hour of Industrialization. Obviously practically for greater separations there would need to be a venture towards transports or maybe a train, an open transportation that emanates less ozone harming substances. I think there is extraordinary potential to make mass transportation much more earth inviting in the event that we give it a possibility.

Before watching the lecture video “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally”, I had no idea the severe impact flying had for the environment. I had always grown up flying in planes, as my parents had been moving a lot at the time. It was always a luxury flying, and I had not thought anything wrong with it. Ken mentioned that every 19 out of 20 people on this earth have never flown in an airplane. This fact was so shocking to me personally, as I always had the impression that a majority of people use air travel.
 <br><br>
The idea that flying in an airplane once already goes over our yearly expected carbon emissions was a little shocking, as I have already gone over my yearly expected carbon intake for most of my life just by riding in airplanes as a young child. 
 <br><br>
I will admit that when Ken started talking about the idea of “extreme travel” that I was a little skeptical. The idea of traveling by train or bus did not sound like a pleasant experience for a long period of time. But the idea of “extreme travel” later had me thinking about how adventurous and inspiring the trip could be. As a culture of people who are so keen on getting where they need to go at an extreme pace, we are always so accustomed to getting to places at a rush. We never get to sit back and enjoy the ride, even though it could feel so much better. I feel like I could enjoy a long train ride or a long bus ride, just to live and experience the world around me without having a concern in the back of my head that i'm harming the planet. 
 <br><br>
After watching this video, it was made clear to me that airplane travel is not only uncommon, but is terrible for the planet. I believe that if I was faced with the option of riding in an airplane again, that I would be more open to other options.

Being able to travel often to places all over the world has always been one of my life goals. Planes are one of humanity's greatest inventions that allow us to connect to friends and family from around the world and experience other places and cultures firsthand. Many of my best memories are from trips to other countries, states, or from my grandparents flying in from Germany to visit me. The amount of times I've flown to Europe and back just to visit them has blown my personal carbon budget of 2 metric tons of per year for almost half of my life thus far, not including all the car trips, purchases, and other activities that I’ve made that have contributed to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While telepresencing through Skype or Facetime is a great way to connect to my family abroad, it's not the same as the experience of really being there with them that only a flight can provide. 

 <br><br>

Although flying abroad is a luxury in itself, finding the time to travel in the midst of school, work, and other commitments are as well. Slow travel and splitting trips up by initially taking a bus or train before hopping on a plane is a great idea to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but part of the issue is finding the time to take extra days or even weeks to get places. Often times people don't live on their own schedules and with the average 2-week vacations most jobs provide employees each year, taking 3-4 days on a train to get to New York before flying abroad, and returning only to spend another 3-4 days on a train again can drastically cut down the time spent at one's actual vacation destination.
  <br><br>

Now I'm not against making changes to benefit the environment and do understand the large scale impact choosing whether to fly or not can have on the climate crisis, I just believe that some of these alternatives are impractical in today's current workforce given typical time constraints placed on vacation time.

I would have to agree with this comment. As much as I support doing our part to help decrease our impact on the environment, I feel as if it is quite unrealistic to ask people to stop using planes. I understand that there is a huge cost associated with flying, but there is also quite a large cost in cutting down on flying. Our time here is short and precious and there is a lot of time that can be wasted, by cutting out on flying. I know that we should be using our time here wisely, but there are places to see and people to see sometimes and there are some experiences you just can’t miss out on, and time restrictions don’t allow for slow transportation. 

  <br><br>

Additionally, if planes somehow become illegal or banned, I don’t believe that this will only reduce flying, I believe that this will also reduce traveling in general. People will either not have the time to put in travel time for vacations or they will just not want to go through the effort and time that it would take to arrive at their destination. There is something beneficial in traveling, and learning new things, and becoming cultured and understanding other peoples, and I feel as if taking away flying can take away other things, such as this, as well.
  <br><br>


Even though this sounds like a good idea in theory, I would have to agree that this is just super impractical and unrealistic to ask of people.

In all honesty, this video seemed very similar to the one about cars, leading us towards public transportation.  While I agree with Ken, and I do understand the points that he is making, I feel as though his solutions are somewhat unrealistic with modern society.  It would be ideal if people simply didn’t travel, or traveled only by train and bus, or telepresented more often.  However, it seems naive, almost, to think that these are realistic solutions.  I found the comment about telepresence particularly interesting.  In this day and age, we often hear so many remarks about how society as a whole, is too wrapped up in social media, and the internet/technology in general.  Here, Ken is telling us that instead of visiting our loved ones, we should do our best to communicate with them primarily over these new technological advances.  However, this is not realistic.  Unfortunately, nothing beats a face to face interaction with your friends and family.  While more realistic, I still find the solution of slow travel to be somewhat difficult to see happening as well.  While it is definitely possible to mostly travel through train, or bus, or even bike, the likelihood that people will take this option is definitely low.  
  <br><br>


I believe that the true solution to this is technological development of flight that will produce less or no greenhouse gasses.  I understand that this is coming from me, someone who knows nothing about engineering a plane, but I do believe that this is a more realistic solution than to expect people to begin taking action personally to travel by flight less.  The difficult thing with these issues, is that most of them come from new technologies that didn’t exist, or exist in the volume that they do now, in the early 19th century: cars, planes, etc.  Once access to these amazing technologies develop, and people begin using them, they aren’t things that are easy to give up.

For all the time I have been consistent with professor, however, this time I hardly agree with you. Since I am an international student, this kind of situation determines that I cannot avoid of taking plane to travel. If some one says that you can travel by ship, that might be ridiculous, because that takes a lot of time to get the destination, and by the time I arrived, there no much time left for me to gather with my family, and the time spend on traveling is extremely tedious. Moreover, I am very fascinating of traveling around the world. By the time I know that I cannot travel with plane, I am depressed a lot. Since I cannot travel with plane, and other transportation takes much more time, it’s nearly impossible for me to travel around the world right now. Probably I can reduce the frequency of traveling around the world, but I cannot stop traveling since I am so obsessed with it.

I agree with you. It's kind of ridiculous for people to blandly ask us to take trains, bikes, or buses without any further consideration. There's no way for us to travel that far with those transportation methods, even in the States. I would be willing to take those public transportations to reduce my carbon footprint if I'm not in a rush or I'm not going anywhere super far away. But definitely not for a long-distance trip to another continent.

I was kind of surprised to know that there will be this much, nearly three tons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere each person every time when we take an airplane. This amount is indeed so much more than we take other transportations or have other daily live activities e.g. eating beef,etc. However, I understand that with the convenience of airplanes, sometimes we might need to really take the airplanes to save our time. But if we have a choice, we should make a decision that is good for our environment.

  <br><br>

I personally have experience both taking planes and bus/train from Santa Barbara to SF and coming back. The time that I actually will take the plane because I got an important appointment that I have to come back and forth in a short time. But usually, I would take the train or get a rideshare if I am going back home. Compared to taking an airplane, not just the fees will be so much cheaper, but it is nice to spend time on the bus/train/car for an extra few hours to enjoy the view. Most importantly, we choose a more environmentally friendly one that does more good to the place we all live.

  <br><br>

There is no need to completely abandon the use of airplanes at all because it is hard to do that and sometimes we might really need to take airplanes on some occasions. Increase in the development of technology allows us to get connected with our friends and families more easily than before. So there are more choices on how to travel to places and to see people we love. Slow travel doesn’t at all is a bad idea and it maybe one day become a more popular choice.

I agree with you as well, as it is hard for me to visualize the complete and total abandonment of airplane/jets because the way the world has been shaped. The world in it's own right has grown smaller and smaller as the technological advancements has brought the world close enough to be the touch of a screen away from each other and become a world of convenience. Businesses trips for instance, require fast and precise timing because it's a professional field that require pin point accuracy and timing and would be hurt through the removal of major conveniences like the airplane/jet which allow business to be conducted overseas and hard to reach places that are out bounded by normal travel.
  <br><br>


Though yes the airplane is very dangerous for our planet and a crucial component we can go after to prevent the their wider damage on our planet's atmosphere, I believe a better solution would result in the international community to limit the amount of flights that part take. Flights that consistently go on and on such as the LA to London flight, those very passage ways can be limited to certain amount of flights over time, and in result would make the most serious dedicated to the flight at the upmost importance and others to look for other cleaner ways of travel like train as Ken did so himself going across the United States. This would also encourage people to even partake in slow travel, which I agree on with Ken, that the voyage in most cases, is more meaningful than  the actual destination in it's own right and can even bring revenue to smaller towns that were once passed over by flight. 

  <br><br>

An example of this was Route 66, though yes it was a road driven on by thousands and thousands of cars, many small towns grew up on that road especially in the Midwest which acted as checkpoints for travelers. As the invention of Airliners took off, these small towns where abandoned due to the lack of travelling revenue that wasn't being brought to them as they starved to the greater convenience of airlines. However, slow travel can perhaps bring this back and reintroduce small towns across railway lines, small roads, like as we see up coastal California, and revenue to flow throughout rather be jointed in at points where major airports live like LAX.

  <br><br>

And yet, even the devastation they do so bring, its hard to oust them out completely, as Airliners are important in keeping connections all across the world and make the world a lot more closer together, but a limitation on their use would be beneficial and a better investment in public transportation like buses and trains would be suffice as major solutions.


<br><hr>
I too was surprised at how much CO2 is emitted when we fly. I also am from SF and during breaks I usually drive to and from Santa Barbara with my roommate. However, twice our schedules have conflicted with leaving dates and I have flown to SF. After learning about the hugely negative effects of airplane travel, I will probably rethink the next time I have the option to fly home. I have not been on a train in a long time, and from what I have heard it is pretty enjoyable. Taking a train would, as you have also said, be much cheaper than flying. I agree that it would be impossible to abandon airplanes altogether. They are much too useful in our society, for travel efficiency across large distances for seeing far-away family members or going someplace far. I agree that we could promote an increase in slow travel methods over airplanes, but we should also try to limit the amount of private jets that fly.

After learning how destructive flying is for the environment, I was really surprised at how much CO2 is released in the atmosphere. It is surprising that there are almost 3 tons of CO2 is released in the air per trip. People prefer to fly because it is convenient and saves alot a time, despite the fact that it is really expensive. We live in a society where transportation for work purposes is very common, normalizing the idea of flying.
  <br><br>

I believe that we should seek alternative methods of transportation before we choose to fly. Public transportation methods such as bussing, train, or ride sharing are more sustainable methods to get to where you need. Walking and biking are the best ways to reduce our carbon footprint. It doesn't release any emissions into the air and it is very cost effective.

YES. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. Modern society is influenced by work--oriented lifestyles and the normalize the idea that flying is "okay" as it could help with jobs and family gatherings. However there NEEDS to be a shift toward alternative methods to leave less of a carbon footprint. I too like to walk and bike.


<br><hr>
While I agree with you that we need to push for alternatives to flying, I think we still need to be realistic in regards to solutions that actually have a possibility of being embraced by a significant portion of the population and have a real impact on combatting climate change. While idealistic proposals envisioning a completely revitalized public transportation system in the U.S. are great to dream about, I think we need immediate change to be implemented through different means, at least until there is enough public support for more comprehensive solutions. 
  <br><br>
Supporting more reasonably achievable solutions does not mean we have to compromise in regards to helping to curb climate change. I believe that by thinking more creative we can still accomplish ambitious goals while doing so in a timely manner with the support of a lot of people. In this case, instead of assuming many people are going to start taking greyhound buses instead of flights, we can think realistically and critically about the best way to reduce the number of flights, and in turn, CO2 emissions. As Ken mentioned in this video, the biggest contributing factor to the large amount of flights is business travel, both on commercial planes and private jets. He also proposed how video-teleconferences could replace business travel and large conferences where tons of people all take long flights. These types of technological solutions are relatively easy to implement since we already have the technological infrastructure to implement this change. All we need to do is continue to spread awareness about this issue and have large organizations such as the UC system or big companies begin to replace work travel with virtual conferences. I think that this is a great idea that can actually have an impact and I think we as students can start by placing pressure on our own university to be at the forefront of change.

This lecture brought me a lot of new ideas, and I have to think about how much damage the transportations to our environments. I almost take the plane to travel every year, and I did not think about the efficiency and sustainability of transportation cannot coexist. Every time when I got back to the US by plane, I did appreciate the existence of this kind of transportation. Sometimes it is ambivalent to balance between technology innovation and the environment. What we can do is minimize the times we travel by planes or any other high-cost transportations. I do feel bad if I think about how much I damage the environment by taking planes. There are so many alternative ways to travel. Now when I see the mile number I accumulated by taking airplanes, I never feel satisfied because I much discount I gonna get for the next trip, but only the guilty for I much carbon footprints I made to ruin the environment.

I agree, this video made me think differently about air travel. Prior to this video, I never knew how damaging to the environment it was to fly and the impact of my carbon footprint. There are many other modes of transportation, but for the U.S. its either plane or car. The U.S. needs efficient and sustainable modes of transportation, one that should mirror Europe’s. I feel guilty knowing my impact on the environment from my air travel. However, it is important to recognize this reality and the impact it creates on the environment in order to create change. Kaiyi, I couldn’t agree more with you, we need a balance between technological innovation that is environmentally sustainable for travel!

I always liked to consider myself somewhat environmentally conscious since I'm a vegetarian and make my best effort to reduce my carbon emissions. This lecture however completely changed my perspective on my personal carbon footprint. I'm an out of state student so I fly often throughout the year. I was astonished to hear that my air travel entirely cancels out any carbon footprint reduction efforts I have made. The idea of slow travel is really interesting to me and could definitely work in some circumstances but I do not think it would be an effective solution for me personally. Due to the great distance and time limitations I have when traveling slow travel would be pretty impractical and difficult. I do however think that slow travel should be used more and marketed as a positive experience. If more people were inclined and able to make travel a longer process I see no downsides to the slow travel method.

As I am also a vegetarian and environmentally conscious of my actions, I found it hard to learn of all the damages air travel has on our planet. To think that all of my attempts to live a more sustainable life could be outweighed by air travel is extremely disheartening. While I wouldn’t consider myself a “frequent flyer,” I definitely have made an unfortunate mark on the planet with my vacations over the past few years. Although flying contributes heavily to the issue of excess carbon emissions, there are ways to offset one’s flight carbon footprint. Various companies allow passengers to calculate their carbon footprint of a specific flight and pay its equivalent toward carbon-reducing projects. I understand this solution is not perfect, but it is much more realistic for people who do not have the luxury of time and therefore cannot participate in “slow travel.”

  <br><br>

While I recognize that air travel is horrible for the planet in its carbon emissions, I believe there is a real beauty in exploring and adventuring in new places. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, there are ways one can shorten their air travel time, sometimes the timing/hassle of slow travel is unrealistic. I think it would be very beneficial for the United States to adopt something similar to the train system throughout Europe. While there are trains in the United States, they are not nearly as popular as those in Europe. The European train system allows travelers to conveniently travel from city to city, and even country to country. If the United States were to implement a more widely accessible train system, I believe that air travel could become less common, as slower travel would become more convenient and realistic.

Obviously, I never thought planes were great for the environment, but I had no idea on the overall impact it had on a person's carbon footprint. The fact that a round trip from Los Angeles to Paris would constitute for 1.5 years of the amount of carbon footprint we should be emitting was a shocking fact for me. This flight contributes 3 tons of co2 to our upper atmosphere. These are insane numbers for just a single trip. I will never look at private jets as a luxurious purchase but now as a highly foolish and dangerous one. 
  <br><br>

living in the privileged bubble of American culture, I would never consider myself part of the top 5 percent, but from this lecture I realize how insanely fortunate I am for the life I live. In the grand scheme of things, Americans in general are very privileged people, but to me, as someone who has only flown twice in my life, I never saw it that way. I always compare myself to the top 5 percent of Americans and think how much I dont have but I now realize I should really widen my perspective. Now knowing how little most people have never even stepped foot on a plane shows me how small my perspective on life is. In terms of our world it is a huge luxury and, of course, it is very dangerous for our environment. Flying is another example of how the richest people in our world cause the most damage to our climate. 80 percent of flights are the result of 1 percent and these flights constitute 2.5 to our climate change crisis. 
  <br><br>

In the future I definitely will try to encourage taking the train or alternatives in order to lessen my carbon footprint. To me, a longer trip is more fun because of the conversations and memories that are able to be made. To me, a trip cross country on a train in addition to a plane ride to Europe sounds a lot more appealing than one uncomfortable trip straight to Europe. A cross country trip would not only provide a more in depth view of America with all of the stops on the way but would give my family more time to talk and bond on the ride over.

This lecture was a little more awkward to sit through only because it hit so close to home. It was also one of the few lectures that left me feeling helpless more than empowered. I would say that I am a frequent flyer, only because I am an international student from Thailand. My family has also wanted me to have experienced many cultures, so I have had my fair share of annual family vacations. I was shocked to find that 80% of air travel was coming from the 1%. I always had this notion that so many people contributed to air travel, but I guess that was oblivious for me to assume. 
  <br><br>

What stood out to me the most was Ken’s suggestion of the slow travel movement. As fun as this could be, I don’t think that it is practical for many people, who go to work, have families and don’t have a week to get from point A to point B. I also thought that this movement does not account for many countries outside of America and Europe. I think that the use of trains and buses is already a prominent part of the European culture, but not so much in the States. But, I am from Asia, and the slow travel movement just isn’t suitable for getting  from country to country in Asia. I typically fly to Dubai once a year to visit my aunt, a flight which would take 6-7 hours. That isn’t that much longer than a flight from LA to NY. But switching between trains and buses to get there just is not possible. So, I think that for something like air travel it wouldn’t be crazy to look to technology. It’s just frustrating because if the slow travel movement isn’t possible for me, how can I do better? It would be sad to think that the only solution would be to just not fly to Dubai anymore, because I find a lot of joy in visiting my aunt who I look up to and basically raised my like a second mother.

Although a little guilty about the huge amount of carbon emissions caused by flights, I have to say, I am a frequent flyer, and I have to be. I live in China, a place which is 14-hours flights away from California. A shockingly long way for many people, but I have to do this at least 4 times a year, since I have to go home to accompany my parents and to enjoy sometime at home during the summer and winter breaks. After watching Ken’s video, I feel really upset, since it is a thing that I want to change but I just can’t. It’s actually not possible for me to cross the Pacific by boat, it will take more than a month and I believe I don’t have that long time to be wasted. I am more willing to spend this month to learn some new things, or even to be a volunteer to help people acknowledge the seriousness about climate change, rather than spend this month on the boat. Although flying maybe the worst way to choose in the environmental aspects, it may be the best in other aspects, like in the practical aspect. In addition, using two months for a round trip may even lead to me late for school during the winter or spring break. So, I can’t come up with a solution with what should I do, doing the seemingly right thing or doing the environmental right thing?

<p>

To answer Ken’s question at the end of the video, I don’t think we should cut out flying completely from our lives, but without a doubt we should reduce our flying behaviors. Especially when it comes to short distances such as LA to SF, there should be no usage of flying for these instances. There’s this aspect of seeing another country or culture with your own eyes and understanding what life is like in other places and I believe that taking out flying completely from our lives can damage this sort of experience and make us more ignorant when it comes to other cultures. Trying to replace this in person experience with Facetime is simply not the same or even comparable in my opinion. In fact, this behavioral change can suck us into our phones even more than we already are, causing us to lose even more touch with what is presently around us. I like Ken’s idea of taking a trip partly by train and partly by flight. I would assume that a lot of flights might occur for business conferences and that conference can be easily done through Facetime calls, Skype, or Google Hangout. As of now, I do not see the slow travel movement being realistic within how our society currently functions. Simply put, people do not want to travel 3 days by bike with their family from LA to SF and then 3 days of biking back. What if one is traveling with a young child, imagine having to deal with a complaining young child, most people don’t even want to imagine it let alone actually have to deal with it. Realistically speaking, all members of the family do not have the same stamina and pace, thus having to wait or be faster for the family might make the trip feel more like a chore than a luxury. If we were to incorporate the slow travel movement, I would suggest we could travel by bike 3 days up and then take a train back done. After all, it is still being more eco friendly than round trip from LA to SF by car or train, and certainly more eco-friendly than a plane.
  <br><br>

    The fact that 19/20 people in the world in a plane just shows to the extent how much of a luxury flying truly is. Even half of Americans do not fly annually, which is shocking considering how much we tend to overdo things to the point where we intensely damage our planet. The fact that 80% of all flights were made by 1% of the people in the world just feeds to this idea of “the 1%.” At first I was confused by a roundtrip flight from LA to Paris would be 3 metric tons of CO2, while first class would be 6 metric tons of CO2, but now that I feel I understand. I think it is because two couch seats could fit where one first class seat is, thus when flying first class you are contributing the CO2 of two coach passengers. If this is not why can someone please clarify to me?

The slow travel movement may be hard at the beginning. For example, if just a few people do not take the airplane, there will be the same amount of air travel as usual. Only when the people who change air travel to other transportation increase to make airline companies lose money for the current amount of flights, and then, the airline companies will start to decrease the amount of flight. 

  <br><br>

I do not think this is practical. This is against human nature. To meet desire is the main cause of the development of the world. A lot of selfish people work together to benefit the world. To travel faster and more comfortable are the main purpose for the most traveler. To show off their wealth by jet, or simply luxury goods are the most efficient way to separate the class. I do not say they were doing those things right, but this was just the fact which hardly to change. Unless people already boring with physical material, people will not pursuit something which does not benefit themself, but benefit others in the distant future and people who be benefited never know his name.

Where do I even start. I am definitely in a bit of a predicament about flying. I now understand how utterly terrible it can be for the environment yet the alternatives that Ken suggests are really not feasible for the reasons I use air travel. I have played sports for a large part of my life and many times flown to tournament locations etc. There is no way that a large team would opt to drive or bus or train from California to Colorado, the East Coast, etc. The main reason is because for the greater part of the year we are in school, so the need for quick travel to a far away location can only be accomplished by planes. 

  <br><br>

To argue that sports should be kept local and traveling isn’t necessary would be outrageous in my opinion. The lessons I have learned, friends I have made, and memories that will last forever far outweigh my guilt about air travel. 

  <br><br>

Currently, I still travel with a sports team at UCSB and to get to tournaments in Michigan, Arizona, Indiana, etc. we have to use air travel. Again, the main reason being that we are students and cannot just take a week off to see the sights on the train to travel to our tournament location.
  <br><br>


Ken’s suggestions for air travel are suitable for some, perhaps, but this is definitely something I could not stand to give up.

On YouTube, I have always seen videos where people are part of the “high mile club” meaning that they fly frequently enough to get first-class without paying extra and they do a tour of the plane to advertise how good or bad the airline is. Watching those videos made me think that it was so cool to get a free upgrade to first-class from economy-class and how I wished I was in their position where they travel frequently enough where they can get an advantage. After watching Ken’s video regarding how flying frequently is bad for the environment made me think twice about whether I should fly or ride the train. I think Ken made some fairly good points but when he spoke about taking a train up to San Francisco for 8 hours, I think that’s not a good choice because if you’re in a hurry to get up to SF, you wouldn’t even be able to enjoy the scenery like Ken said he would. If you have some kind of emergency, I think they should fly instead because Ken also made a point saying get one big vacation instead of multiple small ones so you don’t have as much carbon footprint. 
  <br><br>
I don’t fly that often but when I do, I do go to far places and it isn’t right after the previous vacation which makes me feel better about my carbon footprint but I do know my carbon footprint in comparison to others, might be a lot higher than other people. I wonder for international students, how often do they normally fly back to their homeland and how much their carbon footprint is in comparison to mine.

It is unfortunate to hear how terrible air travel is for the environment. Air travel is usually an unavoidable decision. You can’t drive across the Pacific if you want to get to Hawaii. And no one sailing to the hotel in Maui. In this, I see that the wealthy are getting blamed for this vice to the climate. But many middle-class and even lower-income people fly as well. Whether this is for business, family, or foreign travel, it is usually an unavoidable expense. I’m curious to see how we overcome this since we definitely cannot include flight in our carbon budgets. Will we be able to go to other countries we have to sail. Hopefully, we devise a monorail that gets us over to Europe in a couple of hours. I don’t know, but we definitely cannot keep air travel as it is today.

This video really made me rethink my choices for future travel as well. Since I have attended college, I have not flown as much as I have used to. However, the last time I flew was when I went to Vegas from Santa Barbara. This distance is not very significant and it would have been better for me to just take a train. It would have also saved me a lot of stress since when I flew, my flights kept getting delayed and I ended up at an airport further away than when I started. I eventually ended up in Vegas, but after much hassle. I agree that taking a train also has its perks because you can enjoy the scenery on the way to your destination. I agree with this because I know when I take the bus downtown I like to look at what is around me because it allows me to discover places I can got with my friends when the weekend comes. Unlike airplanes, where a majority of the time all you can see is clouds. When I was in high school, I regret to admit that I flew quite a lot. I was flying once a year, but I did know that as soon as college started this was going I was not going to fly as much because It is just too expensive and I do not plan to fly anywhere in the near future. Mass transit is also a cheaper option in terms of travel. It may take longer, but it will also save you a lot of money. I know that some people travel very far distances, which would make it absolutely unbearable to take the bus or train all the way there. This is why I also agree with even if you have no other option than to fly, then you should not do it often. This shouldn't be very hard to do and in my opinion it would actually be more pleasurable because you would be able to extend the length of your vacation. As for you last sentence, I always wondered about that too. I know that the video states that 19/20 people will never set foot in a plane, but I do not a lot of people who take a plane on a regular basis as to go home every break.

Professor Ken mentioned many facts about disadvantages of traveling by air. It is true that taking airplane will cause a huge amount of greenhouse gases emission into the atmosphere directly, especially when you are sitting in first class. The solutions of this issue are helpful. For example, taking trains and enjoying a slow trip will absolutely cut down the emission of greenhouse gases. In this way, travelers can enjoy the scenery along the way. When it comes to businessmen, they can negotiate by online meeting. It is convenient and cost less. When it comes to travelling, we can reduce the frequency of travelling. If we must take an air, we should better take non-stop flight.
<br><br>
After watching the lecture, I will try to decrease the number of flight I take. However, as an international student, I must travel to the United States from Beijing by plane. Thus, I will take non-stop flights in the future. Hopefully, everyone could make an effort to stop this climate crisis.

Its amazing to me to think only 5% of the Earth’s population has flown. This statistic makes me think others see flying as a luxury and would want to experience it. Sadly this luxury has detrimental effects to the environment and people need to stop flying or at least fly less! It’s crazy to think that flying in economy once can equal to emitting 3.5 metric tons of CO2 which is a lot more than what you should limit yourself to emitting for the year which is 2 metric tons of CO2. What’s worse is that by flying first class emits 6 metric tons of CO2 which is double. Once again flying first class is a luxury that many want to achieve or do but it is just harmful to the environment. As a society we should promote the use of trains to get across land since they are way more eco-friendly. I myself have traveled to other countries and flown but due to this new found knowledge, I will think twice about flying and traveling. Maybe instead of flying every year or two I would limit it to once every 5 or even 10 years.

Growing up my family and I never had the privilege to take any family trips and travel via plane. It never occurred to me that traveling often to other countries and states was a thing until I came to Santa Barbara. Now that I am in college with some sort of independence and money from the jobs I work, I can’t wait to travel. In fact, I am in the process of planning a 2 week trip in Europe with my boyfriend. Although I am excited to leave the US, after watching this video, I need to take a closer examination of how we plan to travel. 
<br><br>

The fact that 19 out of 20 people in the world have not stepped foot onto a plane and that 80% of flights are made by 1% of the population is truly shocking. Hearing these facts really put me into my place and was extremely convenient to hear as I am purchasing flight tickets very soon. I know look back at the times I was happy to see a flight from Paris to Barcelona was only about 2 hours and see it as a horrendous way of getting around that disgustingly contributes to the climate crisis worse than anything else I could possibly choose to do. 
<br><br>

To answer your question Ken, how do we begin reducing our air travel? I believe your suggestion of slow travel is a good approach to this. Slow travel is appealing because it wouldn’t be as detrimental as flying, however it is slow. I believe slow travel would appeal to a lot more people if it was faster, since I am assuming the reason why most people fly via plane is its quickness. This may sound silly, but if we could make slow travel a bit more quicker and efficient, we may be able to lessen the popularity of air travel.

The whole point of slow travel is that it is slow. I think you are talking about medium-speed travel like trains and buses to become more popular and flying less popular. I am a frequent air traveler and did not know that I am in the 1% of people that emit so much CO2. In fact, I was astounded because I thought of myself as an environmentalist. I do whatever I can to help the planet, but now I cannot undo my actions of air travel. I simply will have to cut that out of my life and start to only travel by buses, trains, and even slow travel. The slow travel thing appeals to me, but riding a bike on the side of the freeway is simply not safe. If we had the infrastructure to slow travel, I think a lot more environmentalists would do so. Having safe bike lanes and rest areas would make the bike ride to the Bay much more appealing. 
<br><br>


Another point that I wanted to make was that you assumed that the reason why most people fly via plane vs train or bus is because it is quicker. Yes it is quicker, but this is not the reason. The simple matter of fact is that it is a whole lot cheaper! You wouldn't think so, but it's true because of our subsidies on oil and gas. If one wants to travel from Barcelona to Copenhagen, you have to go thru many different countries with different train systems. The layovers never match up and you need a separate ticket for each leg of the journey. I tried this last summer because I simply like to travel by train, but the cheapest train tickets I could find, all in all, came out to about $550 US (and take a couple days) while flying would only cost 
<br><br>

about $100. This fact is encouraging people to fly, and we need to make changes to our infrastructure first to incentivize people to travel by train and bus rather than flying.

Before watching the lecture video, I had no idea how detrimental air travels are to the environment , nor did I know about the fact that a single flight I take can single handedly make all the other actions I take to try to reduce my carbon footprint meaningless. Being the 1 out of 20 people on the planet and as a regular flyer (I fly around 6 times a year), this lecture video certainly changed my perspective and made me rethink about the ways I could travel in the future. My experiences with traveling are mostly flying overseas, but now that I’ve learned about the consequences of flying, I would definitely look into other ways of transportation such as taking a cruise. At the same time, taking trains to states on the other side of the country and take international flights do not sound that bad either. Ken proposed a very interesting concept of “slow travel” and I was greatly intrigued by it, I believe if we encourage and foster a new tourism culture that focuses on “slow travel” on top of improving and expanding options of transportations that significantly emit less carbon footprint, we could provide travelers incentives to not take flights. For example, if the high speed rail system (bullet train) was implemented in California and made cost-effective, a lot of people would definitely switch to traveling on land than in air.

You mentioned that flying sort of cancels out other efforts of trying to reduce our carbon footprint...do you think this makes is discouraging for people to try and say for example not eat meat or drive around less-because of the fact that if they fly, their other efforts are "meaningless"? While we can't deny the carbon footprint of flying, I think we should be careful to not dismiss efforts, no matter how small, because taking small steps is already discouraging enough && I think the mindset of "what's the point" is a lot of the reason people aren't doing anything nowadays, or in the past, to try and improve their carbon footprint. I too liked the idea of slow travel, if I have time, especially the idea of a train. I really liked how Ken said we should make traveling about the traveling and not so much the destination. I think this would help a lot of people, myself included, not worry so much about hotels and costs of living once arrived at the destination if we focus more on the days leading up to the destination (ie., taking a train and enjoying the scenery).


<br><hr>
 you may get the impression that by comparing the amount of carbon footprint released by air travel and other efforts, some people might get discouraged and not act at all whenever they take flights. However, this way of thinking cannot be applied to everybody. There have to be people who see the significant carbon footprint released by flights as a source of motivation to do more and try to restore what's done to the environment (myself included). Anyways, I think what's important as of now is to continue educating those around us about ways in which we can travel and at the same time emit the least carbon footprint.

<p>
I’ve been waiting for this topic to come up, because I’ve known air travel is terrible for the planet, but I internally refused to stop taking planes, until now. The example Ken gave in the beginning of the video especially struck me because just last spring I took a plane ride from LA to Paris, and that trip alone constitutes what should be my greenhouse emission for a year and a half. 
<br><br>

I usually don’t fly much anway, maybe a round trip once a year, but when I do it’s to visit family in Mexico and I do not see how I can stop from flying. The only other option would be to drive, which is still detrimental to the environment and my family restrains from doing so anyway because it is dangerous to drive there at night. If I go to San Francisco I can easily convince my family to travel by train, but going to New York by train would be difficult to get by them, and going to Mexico would be impossible without air travel. That being said I do think travelling by train is fun, and I often do so if I go home (to LA). Though I admit low travel does sound unappealing at first, it can be a substitute for road trips and it can be very fun travelling along the coast. 
<br><br>

Yet, without faster and more efficient mass transportation, I do not think it is possible to get people to stop flying. I’ve been seeing a picture on Twitter recently of a high speed train plan that covers most of the U.S., and definitely major cities. I don’t think it’s real and even if it is I’m sure it’s going to take forever to pass the necessary laws and then to build, but it seems very cool and a lot of people (including myself) are extremely interested in it. So, I’m definitely going to try to fly less and take more trains, but as someone who loves to travel and who mostly travels with family, it’s going to be difficult, but I must try.

“When I do it’s to visit family in Mexico and I do not see how I can stop from flying. The only other option would be to drive, which is still detrimental to the environment and my family restrains from doing so anyway because it is dangerous to drive there at night.”  I know that I am especially guilty of this because I travel once a year to visit family in Mexico. I often travel coach but once in 2016 my sister, mother and I bought first class seats from Queretaro to Yucatan. The whole flight was less than an hour and it would’ve taken us 5 hours on the bus, so at the time we thought we made a great decision. We might’ve spent more but we wouldn’t have to sit in that uncomfortable bus driving through desolate and often dangerous areas at night. However, now I realize that I alone emitted 10 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere that year. I am so ashamed of not knowing better and not taking the time to realize how my actions would affect the climate. I believe that I am making progress though because through this class I am learning so much about how the individual can do their part in solving the climate crisis. This video was so surprising to me. I had taken two environmental studies classes before but I did not know that nearly two tons of carbon dioxide was emitted into the atmosphere each time we took a flight. That number triples in quantity if one buys a first class class seat.Professor Ken mentioned that taking trains or riding a slow bicycle trip from your location to your destination would be rewarding in the long run. I have friends who have taken flights from the Santa Barbara Airport to their hometowns and I always sort of envied them for that. I always took the 6 hour trips on the Amtrak. I am now glad I never did because not only were the trips mostly enjoyable but were relaxing with beautiful scenic views of the Pacific. I hope people could take away valuable lessons from this video, especially those who travel more than me.
<br><hr>
I know how convenient it is to want to save time by flying instead of taking the bus, it makes total sense especially when you are visiting family you don't see regularly and you want to take advantage of your time. I also feel ashamed of not knowing better before, which is why I chose to take this class. I too think I am making progress because I know I will choose to live in smaller homes in the future, I do not eat beef anymore (if anything once a month but I will completely cut it out soon), and I am starting to thrift more than usual. I also take the Amtrak Pacific Surfline, and my ride is only 3 hours and I enjoy doing so because its relaxing and better for the planet. I also know people who travel a lot more than I do, so I hope they know the effects to the actions.

Personally speaking, I am not a frequent traveler who will like to spend most of my time on a plane, but I totally agree with what Ken said in the lecture video. Flying would have a large impact on our carbon footprint. To mitigate the carbon emissions of flying, Ken has provided us some possible solutions like taking a train to an airport in which closer to your final destination, which would reduce the amount of time you stay on a plane and the carbon you produced. Whether we are taking a plane is merely a personal choice. I believe there are still many ways for us to reduce carbon emissions. If we insist on doing the right things, the climate issue will be solved sooner or later.

I like Ken's video,  especially his idea about "slow life", the idea of slow travel is exactly the travel style I enjoyed. " Life. is just a journey". I like this idea, and someday I would try this myself. However, for us international students, unluckily, we can not avoid air traveling even it is not joyable and environmental friendly. I will try to do everything I can to help protect the environment myself, I promise. Especially when I am old, I will be the most environmental friendly people on the earth to erase the pain I caused the earth when I have to.

 I also love the idea of the slow travel lifestyle. In my opinion it makes you appreciate the world so much more; you are not only contributing to our environment by leaving a smaller carbon footprint but you are also allowed to take in the scenery of the different places you pass by. I live a few hours away from Santa Barbara so I don't experience the problems that you international students must go through. When it comes down to going back home to visit my family for the holidays or during our breaks, I always take the train back home. It only adds a few extra hours to my trip compared to driving a car back home, but I enjoy it so much more. And not just because of the mere fact that it is environmentally better for us, but I genuinely enjoy the calmness it brings compared to driving on a hectic freeway. I live in the Los Angeles county area and everyone knows how popular the city of Los Angeles is; during my highschool years when I didn't know how to drive, me and my friends would love going to LA on the train and even after when we got older and knew how to drive we would still go to LA on the train because of how much more enjoyable it made our trip. Back then I wasn't aware how much I was already contributing to our climate crisis and now that I am aware of this, it makes me feel content. I hope people take the idea of a slow travel lifestyle into consideration because there are so many other options than taking a car or a plane when it comes to traveling, we just have to open our eyes.

As an international student from China which have a nearly half the Earth distance from America, i need to fly about 2-4 times in a year and it’s a high number of miles because of the long distance. In addition, my family love traveling around, and flying is the priority choice because of its fast speed and convenience. As i recall, we will choose to take plane even there’s a short distance. So, i believe that we’ve been contribute a lot to the emission of CO2 these year.
<br><br>
I knew flying would emit CO2 into the atmosphere and have negative impact on environment. But i never know how much CO2 it will emit. Watching Ken’s lecture made me more clear about it. It is surprising to know that flying for about 24 hours leads to about 3 tons of CO2 to be emitted into the atmosphere and according to the Paris climate accords would account for about a year and half of one’s personal GHG emissions.
<br><br>
Though my family loves traveling, we started to give attention to the environmental problem lately since my mom read an article about flying. So, high-speed railway become another priority choice for us and we start to love taking the high-speed railway to travel for its comfy. Although this method takes more time to get to the destination, it will be great to experience a slow trip as my father said. 
<br><br>
As for me, I will try to take train every short-distance travel and also long term if possible and i hope i can help the emission of CO2 by my little change of travel habit.

I have never thought about the option of first taking a train or a bus, then flying, to cut down on emissions because people usually think about the most convenient thing they can do. It is obvious that celebrities or wealthy people taking their own private jets across long (and even worse, short) distances needs to be minimized because it is a far less efficient form of transportation. The ability to pollute as much as you want but never have to worry about direct effects from climate change is the ultimate privilege and needs to be acknowledged. I care more about those that frequently take business trips across the country or globe because each roundtrip flight contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. I am more understanding of those that want to visit their loved ones and family in other regions of the world, or those who wish to travel. These are times that should be accessible by all people, in my opinion, because why shouldn’t we be able to see the world? As a society, we would be so worse if we never saw or experienced other cultures, ideas, or people. Perhaps we can make travel by boat more, if it makes a difference, if it is as feasible as a mode of transportation. It is interesting to think how normalized and common flying has become in a lot of cultures as it is an invention only about a century ago. I think we would need to change our culture and perception of traveling to move away from dependence on planes. Again, there is going to be a lot of people that will be resistant to this change in lifestyle, but we continue to move towards a more conscientious society and world, so hopefully a transition away from airplanes can come soon. My desire to see parts of Asia is made difficult by the pressure I feel to make decisions that hurt other people and our planet. I can see how hard it is to decide between making personal choices for our own good or happiness and thinking about future generations, when some people conceptually only care about their own pursuits. I do not have an answer, but I will get on board with a great solution.

Great comment and healthy perspective Erin. As an idea i think slow traveling sounds like a fantastic idea. As an international student, I have travelled across nearly all of California, from San Fransisco to San Diego, using AMTRAK and Greyhound, (trains and busses), and I can attest to how beautiful the experience is, getting to see the west coast and go through so many different places and cities, as well as the adventures and people you meet along the way. For me it has become part of the traveling experience.
<br><br>

Having said that, I do not believe that slow traveling is the solution. As Ken said 80% of plane emissions are due to the 1% aka frequent fliers. My father is one of these people. He travels nearly every week and in his life must have taken the plane more than 500 times. He travels for work, like you mentioned, and he hates it, but a lot of people depend on him doing that. People like my father cannot afford to "travel slow" and as work becomes more and more globalized, people have things they need to attend to far away from where they are. Additionally, I do not believe people will cater their holiday plans to save the environment any time soon. For example, taking a huge break off work every 5 years is much more complicated than taking a small holiday every year.
<br><br>

The problem of planes in my opinion can only be solved through electric planes. Unfortunately, these are very difficult to design and we do not currently possess the required technology to make them feasible, primarily energy-density of batteries. They are at least 20 years way from being used commercially, and so in my mind we should focus our energy on other challenges, because plane travel at the moment is not going to change dramatically any time soon.

After watching this video, I agree that people should fly less. It is incredible that fly by airplane could emit such a great amount of CO2. It is important to educate people that how much they could damage our environment by travelling by air. Companies that produce airplanes are also thinking ways that could reduce co2 emission while ensuring that their planes could carry more people.   
<br><br>

However, it is irresponsible that blame China. I am from China. Most populations in China travel by bullet trains, not airplanes. Also, it is not proper by just listing Chinese airplane pollution, which could other students turn to blame China. I have read some comments that students seem to be feared because of the “50% increase”. It is true. But it is America that contributes the most airplane pollution, not only business travel but America fighters and bombers in Iraq and other middle east countries. I really feel that the group of international students from China is targeted because we all travel by air in order to be present in the school in America.

Personally, I hate traveling. However, my family loves to travel and so I grew up flying and visiting countries around the world. I would constantly complain on planes and would always talk about how much I suffered and now, after watching this video, I am appalled at myself. The fact that 19 out of 20 people have never stepped foot on a plane and that just 1% of the population is responsible for 80% of all the flights is just mind blowing to me. To think that I am one of the people who fly often and, therefore, contribute heavily to the increase in CO2 emissions but that I also had the audacity to complain about it is just embarrassing. I grew up very privileged to have the opportunity to travel the world but, at the same time, now that I am educated on the climate crisis, I can no longer travel as often as I’m used to. 
<br><br>

Knowing that the absolute worst thing that you can do with regards to carbon dioxide emissions is flying makes it clear that something in my life needs to change. While I don’t think that taking the train across the country is for me, I absolutely think that I need to be traveling by plane less. I fly to Vegas often because my dad works there. This is something that I need to change because short flights are very bad, especially considering that it would only take four hours to drive and would save me a lot of money. I also have most of my family in Israel so I usually travel there every year. Like Ken mentioned, Skype and Facetime are technology that allows two people to interact with each other in real time. This is important to me because I could see and talk to my grandparents and cousins without taking an expensive 15 hour flight to see them. While I still would like to visit them in real life, because of technology, I can go to Israel less (like every other year, instead of every year).

I think this lecture was hard for many of us to swallow, to find that how frequent we fly has such a large impact on our carbon footprint. As hard as it is to hear that visiting our out-of-state family or friends, it definitely put into perspective how much we should emphasize that we should only fly when we need to. And, Ken is not saying we need to cut out flying altogether, but rather consider options such as commuting to an airport closer to your destination. Slow travel is also an option to consider, while it may not be practical for many it again puts into perspective that there are other means to get to places that in itself can be a worthy experience. Again, practicability may be an obstacle with this option but it is better to consider these options than just choosing to fly because of convenience. Flying like many other of our habits is often done without consideration of its effects, which we can attribute to unawareness or lack of education on the consequences of our lifestyle choices. It is also interesting to consider the fact that 99% of the population isn't contributing the emissions from airplanes. This statistic makes me compare that 1% to instances like when Kourtney Kardashian took a separate private jet from the rest of her family who were also taking another private jet to the same destination because she was "arguing" with them. This is extremely wasteful behavior, and even sadder that I am watching it happen on TV.

I agree with you on the fact that this lecture was hard to swallow. I attribute so much of my character to my experiences I've had in countries overseas, and to put it vaguely: I don't know who I would be today if it wasn't for those experiences. Travel, in my opinion, is one of the most enriching experiences people can have in their lifetime. I feel as though I was exposed to a multitude of different perspectives and got to see the privilege I had to live in America in comparison to the inequalities citizens in other countries became accustomed to. That being said, I find it very hard to come to terms with the fact that through these experiences I was putting the Earth at harm. Despite this realization, I don't regret my decisions to travel but furthermore wish that there was more innovation to compete with conventional air travel. I feel as though I still haven't gotten to see the world yet and still want to experience other cultures, therefore innovation seems to be the next step. Furthermore, I find it highly unlikely that the rich, who have the opportunity to fly wherever with no concerns, will not change their ways despite the harm it is doing to the environment. With the amount of money famous families, such as the Kardashians, have, I doubt I'll be seeing them on my next Amtrak ride. Once privilege is experienced, it's very hard to take away. However, Im not completely pessimistic about the future of air travel. Instead of discouraging airplane usage, education should be spread on the detriment it causes to society so innovators can study how to reduce emissions and make air travel eco friendly. Instead of living without, the world should change and react to the climate crisis by improving so we can learning to live with the privileges we already have but in a safer, and environmentally clean way.

Upon reading the comments of my classmates, I noticed that many people are inconvenienced by slower means of travel. On the other hand, not flying doesn't seem so difficult. Planning around travel days means a more meaningful experience. My family liked to take me to the Bay Area often. Taking the train seems really lovely. If I had more agility, biking would be more appealing. However, there's appeal even in preparing for such a trip. The anticipation in the buildup before the trip would make the experience all the more worth it.
<br><br>


I commute to my hometown of San Diego often, but I've been thinking of the impact of doing so. Taking the train and planning ahead, simply dedicating travel days, isn't so difficult. It just seems that way because so much time is lost in doing so. Yet, in all the times I've taken the train, I've used such time to be productive. Committing to taking the train is a small step that isn't particularly compromising of my time.

After watching this video, I was shocked that flying can produce so many environmental problems. The most impressive example in the video is when someone takes a plane from Los Angeles to Paris, he will produce three tons of carbon dioxide. But if we need to control our speed of global warming, we need to reduce our carbon footprint to two tons per year. It means just one flight will take over all of your carbon dioxide limits. Since among 20 persons, only one person may have not taken planes before, flying accounts for 2% of carbon dioxide in the world.  As an international student, I need to take planes about 6 times per year from China to the United States. To reduce my flying, what I should do is reduce my time to come back to China. Moreover, people will choose planes to travel since it is the fastest way to get to the destination. But in the video, Professor Ken states that we can travel in a slower way. For example, traveling by trains instead of planes. Trains are the most efficient transportation now. Although we may spend more time in our ways, it will reduce a lot of pollution and increase resource utilization rates. Slow travel is a new fashion trend in our daily life. To think about that, our work and study are always in a high-speed way, why don’t we slow down in our travel and to enjoy our life.

I really liked Kens suggestions about the alternatives you can do to limit the amount of times you fly. I think that this issue needs to be talked about a lot more. People are still wanting to vacation everywhere in the world that they can but they're not realizing the effect that it has. So many people want to go to Santorini, Greece. But the area is so old and has become a popular destination that it might be starting to crumble away. Instead of people thinking "oh, there's too many people going we probably shouldn't go", people are saying "let's go before it's no longer there". There's people who live in that area but wealthy people are willing to keep going to these places and destroying them just so they can say they went and post it on instagram. I feel like this idea connects well with the AP Environmental Science term, tragedy of the commons. People are acting in their own self-interest and depleting resources because the idea is that if they don't do it then someone else will, so they might as well reap the benefits too. This is basically the idea that's destroying our planet. The monetization of water and fossil fuels are good examples. More awareness should be built on flying's effect on climate change and people shouldn't be so ignorant/selfish when it comes to traveling.

This news honestly really upsets me because it makes me think that there is nothing in the world that we are doing that is good for it. It frustrates me that flying is really the only option for getting certain places but it has one of the worst effects. Its not like you can bike across the world in order to save emissions. Our fast moving society has put an increased dependence on flying and being able to get places quickly in order to do work and for a lot of people survive, but yet this way of survival is lessening our chances of survival for the future. The slow travel option really isn't practical or realistic for a majority of people unfortunately. I think we have discovered the extent of the effects of flying too late to expect people to change their whole lifestyles based around flying. 
<br><br>

These were my original thoughts but while watching more into the lecture, I realized something ew. While this is true in our world, the fact that 19/20 people have never set foot on an airplane shocks me and makes me think that maybe its only a big deal to us because we are given the opportunities in life to do so. Maybe there is hope for us to change into basically a less developed world. It definitely won't be easy because we are a stubborn country but at least it shows us that it is possible. I think that we do need a better solution thought like the idea behind electric cars (I say idea and not the actual cars themselves as they were proven to not be as helpful as imagined, but it was the good thought that counts). Between telling people to not drive cars and now not fly, I think it is just going to frustrate people and make them give up on trying to do anything at all. We need to be less pessimistic about the negative effects and focus our power more on finding positive solutions rather than saying "no no no" to everything we do without being creative and making a change.

The lecture was a very eye opening video, being apart of a family that is spread out all across America I often use airplanes. Little did I know that every time I took a step on an airplane I was using one and half years worth of my personal carbon dioxide emissions. But I did find this lecture video to be very controversial in my opinion. I agree that airplanes have very bad consequences for the earth but I do not think that facetime and over the phone should replace all of the interactions you have with people who live a distance from you. I think the world should limit the amount of planes that leave from airports and only have one plane going to a  certain airport per day. 

<br><br>

I think that it is crazy that the creation of aluminum and cement is causing the release of two percent of greenhouse gasses emission. I thought that it was interesting that slow foods are going out of business and fast food is becoming the new normal. I hope that as a whole the world can start solving some of the issues that are facing the world because this class is getting me to realize that things are just getting worse and there is not a lot of positive.

While it is astonishing and horrible to realize how detrimental flying is to our environment, I simply cannot get behind the idea of a slow travel movement. Once again, I feel like the blame is unfairly being put on the general public, rather than governments and the air travel industry. If there is any blame too be put on the public, it would be those in first class or private jet users, as this seems incredibly wasteful. However, there isn't any affordable, convenient, or environmentally conscious way to travel across the ocean. 
<br><br>

Ideally, I would like to see countries move towards less flying in country by making trains faster and more convenient, and by creating incentives for train and bus use. However, I don't see an alternate to air travel across oceans, as using boat is extremely slow and expensive, and I doubt is much better for the environment. Unfortunately, flying is a necessary evil. While it is possible for some people to reduce their flying (and they should) for others it is the only way they can visit home or see family in the brief breaks from work people have. I think there should be less pressure on getting people to not fly, but to make flying less environmentally damaging.

This is a frustrating but promotive video. On the one side, it’s frustrating because 2-3 metric tons of carbon dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere per person when we travel by plane, and I’m such a traveling enthusiast and I love to travel by flying around the world due to its quickness and convenience. Like the mini-lecture says, I kept contributing to our greenhouse effect and climate crisis every time I took flight and made our situation worse. On the other side, it’s promotive since I’m now aware of how flying could have a negative influence on our environment and I’m trying to avoid traveling by taking flights as much as possible. After watching this mini-lecture, I realize that in the future, every time when I’m going to start a trip by flying, I could always consider alternatives that are more environmentally friendly and it’s not necessary to fly to my destinations. By changing my mindset in the aspect of the way of transportation, it could help save me a lot of budgets from the flights, reallocate the money to somewhere else, and minimize the detrimental effect brought to the environment.

<br><br>

However, it’s not possible to ban the use of airplanes and the only solution is to reduce the frequency of taking flights. Or our technological development might bring innovations on a contemporary basis and create planes that may reduce oil burning on evaporative emissions and abandon the combustion of gases. Moreover, as Ken mentions, slow travel isn’t a bad idea at all…

At first when Ken started out his lecture by saying “Air Travel only accounts for 2.5% of greenhouse emissions globally,” I was confused. It was definitely an “ah-hah” moment when he explains how riding a plane is a privilege. I use commercial airlines about once a year to travel to Asia to see my relatives. I was never aware or thinking about the carbon I was emitting by purchasing a boarding ticket to enjoy an experience over the summer. This piece of knowledge was very conflicting. The solutions offered are fly less, telepresence technology, and the slow travel movement. Slow travel movement does not work for me simply because there are no trains or bike lines crossing the Atlantic Ocean. I believe that the only solution I can aim for is to fly less and to schedule my trips for every other year. This is hard for me to come to terms with because, when it comes to family, I want to see my family as often as possible. But I have to admit, learning how big of a carbon footprint I could potentially leave behind if I travel by plane is a scary realization. The idea of doubling or tripling my carbon footprint is a hard pill to swallow and something that I have to work on in order to reorient my lifestyle. Since we talked about cars last week, switching the topic to planes was certainly interesting. It is also tied to how taking the bus, train, or biking is still the superior mode of transportation and something that we should strive to do in our daily lives. 
<br><br>
The Paris Accord is a topic that comes up often in this course and a good marker for what we should strive for. As the course progresses, I realize and see how hard it is for everyone to admit on average no more than 2 metric tons per year. From learning how owning a car is already a big chunk of our carbon footprint and now learning that planes are much much worse, I can see how society has oriented itself to contribute to the climate crisis. The idea of shaping society and being able to successfully prevent the Earth from warming is not only daunting but difficult. Ultimately, I have to be hopeful and do my part in the climate crisis.

While watching the video and learning about how devastating flying is for the planet, I began to wonder about those who live in different countries that are a long distance from the US. Since I live in California, it is not necessary for me to fly to go home and see my friends/family. Thus reducing my carbon footprint through cutting out plane rides is not as difficult. While I still would like to travel and vacation, I can plan it as Ken suggested and travel less. However, for someone like you, you seem to not really have a choice. While Skype/ FaceTime are viable options, I know personally that I would be pretty unhappy only being able to communicate to my family through that channel and not being able to see them in person. I feel this issue is definitely easier to deal with for people who live in close proximities to where they are from, and thus we need to come up with better solutions for long-distance travel if we want to make this a world-wide trend.

Before watching this lecture, I had no idea that only 5% of the planet actually uses airplanes to travel. Even worse, 80% of all air travel accounts for only 1% of the population. And traveling by air doubles or even triples your CO2 waste.That sounds terrible. But it seems to me that no one actually knows this information about air travel. We have become accustomed to seeing it as only a privilege that shortens travel time and makes dreams of wanderlust possible. After hearing the statistics, I felt pretty hopeless in regards to an alternative. People need to get around, see family abroad, or travel for work. However, Ken does bring up a good point of merely changing our perception of the issue. It's about realizing that air travel is unsustainable and elite. Very few people actually take airplanes yet it contributes so much to the ongoing climate crisis. In fact, the alternatives to air travel is already here, it just requires much more patience. Yes, slow travel sucks but in the long run think about how much more time you'll have to travel when the planet isn't gone. We also basically have transporters in the form of videochat on our cellphones. This should be especially considered when people have to travel for business meetings. Ultimately, I believe informing people of the positives of our current alternatives can help bolster a movement to reduce air travel.

I have only ever flown twice and both occasions were due to me winning a free roundtrip visiting college campuses. If it were not me winning those free roundtrips, I would not have been able to experience flying. I can understand how 80% of people who travel by plane are part of the one percent. Flying is indeed an expensive luxury that only few people get to experience. Though that may sound unfair, it is somewhat a blessing a disguise. If travel by plane were available to everyone, the 2% of CO2 emissions that come from flying would indeed increase. Not to say that flying should only be kept to the one percent--it should not. And those that do fly, they should consider other alternatives--like slow travel--where their carbon footprint would not be so high. Social media really convinced the public how this image of flying from place to place is a sign of power and money, when that should not be the case.

This lecture video shocked me on how large of an impact flying has on the environment and the fact that a trip from LAX to Paris is the equivalent amount of carbon you should release for 1.5 years. Prior to this video I assumed that flying definitely had a negative effect on the environment but not to the magnitude Professor Hiltner described. It makes me feel guilty to some degree because I love flying and how fast and easy it makes traveling but I care for the environment a lot more than flying I just didn't know the extent of the carbon emitted. Sadly I feel a majority of people who fly aren't aware either and if they were informed may choose the slow movement vacation or fly less frequently for business. Famous people though that use private jets I feel should have to pay a large carbon tax for the amount they'll admit just flying themselves and especially because of how often they use their jets. This would possibly lessen the aw of flying a private jet because of how expensive it'll become possibly reducing the number of times they use their jets which would lead to people looking for environmentally friendly alternatives for flying long distances. Additionally, I love the idea of the slow trip movement because my family and I already take road trips across California to Oregon stopping about in 3 different cities and staying the night on our drive up. I also have taken the train along the coast and the views are always amazing so switching from driving our car to just the train is very doable. However, I feel there still needs to be improvements made to the public transportation system to be able to trump the damaging alternatives. If public transportation was free or near-free a large number of people would switch purely for the economic gain and if somehow you made the ride in them more appealing by having a tv, outlets, free wifi and comfier seating you could switch even more individuals to public transportation. I feel the government should implement some form of a carbon tax on all fossil fuel and use the revenue generated from this to vastly improve transportation because the general public just needs to be convinced it's cool or they have something to gain from choosing public transportation over the other options.

I feel the same way, I was not aware of the fact that flying contributed that much to the emissions of CO2 and I completely agree that the majority of people don’t know either. If I’d never taken this class, who knows when I would’ve found out, most likely when it would be too late. At least now I’m more aware of the consequences of flying and can inform others and encourage them to not fly as often or just simply take an alternative means of transportation to their destination.  
<br><br>
Every time Ken brought up private jets, I too thought about how famous people fly in them on the daily. It’s crazy how one day they could be in one city and the next day they’re in another country, imagine the absurd amount of CO2 they produce while they do these trips. I also think they should pay a carbon tax, but I sadly don’t think it’s going to stop them from flying so much considering they make a ton of money. Hopefully soon we can come up with an alternative way of getting people to their destinations in an economically safe and timely manner.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment because I also did not think that flying had such a big impact on our environment, but now it makes sense.  It is surprising that such a small percent of the population creates such a great amount of environmental damage, specifically how 80% of all flights are made by 1% of the people on the planet. I personally do not travel often because I have no reason to, but I have traveled by plane before. As I was flying I did not think about the damage that was being done because all I could think about was getting to the east coast. I also did not think about it because as Ken mentioned, approaching our personal actions and how they contribute to the overall problem can be uncomfortable. I did not want to think about the negatives of air travel, I simply wanted to enjoy the experience. Even though I do not travel often, I would like to think that when I have to travel somewhere in the future, I will take part in the slow travel movement. Not only would this be more environmentally friendly, it would also allow me to take in all the beauty the world has to offer. I agree with your statement that wealthy people who ride private jets should pay a carbon tax. This would not only compensate for the damaging they are causing, it would also prove that flying is the worst thing you can do environmentally. This goes back to the fact that the wealthy are the ones that create the most damage to our planet and to the poor. Not only in the fashion industry, in the automobile industry, but also in the air travel industry. As Ken mentions, we have to really consider when air traveling is vital. We have other forms of communicating that can compensate for meetings between people when they are not essential, like Skype. However, this is not the same as a face to face encounter, which is why we always have to take into consideration who and what matters enough to the point where an airplane ride and its consequences are worth it.

I have never thought about slow travel, I guess culturally fast travel is the only thing I was ever made to think about. After I read the title of this lecture video I thought that I would be bummed out after watching it, but on the contrary I feel oddly excited about the prospects of slow travel. I have been lucky enough to travel via plane a few times in my life– it always has felt terrible: from the lines, to the waiting, to your skin feeling super dried out from flying, it is not a fun experience. I have also typically felt groggy from get lag, and grumpy for the following few days because of any time change. Fast travel throws me, and probably many other people, out of wack to say the least. 

<br><br>

I felt so intrigued by the idea of traveling via train or even a bike... especially a bike! I had never thought about using a bike to travel a substantial distance. It seems like good exercise, way more fun, and way less stressful than a plane ride. It honestly sounds like an actual adventure. And as far as travelling by train, I guess that I never thought of using one for vacationing activities. I frequently take the metro from Goleta to Rancho Cucamonga to go home. I honestly was unaware that there was any infrastructure that could offer a vacation-like journey. I am super interested in the slow travel movement. 

<br><br>

My brother and I were thinking of planning a trip for over the summer, we were thinking of going abroad– but now I kind of want to go somewhere by train just for the experience!

Likewise, after watching this video, I’m kind of excited about the future of slow travel if people really buy into the idea of reducing carbon emissions. I have flown a lot in my life, and like you, it has always been pretty terrible experiences. My parents never understand why, but I always tell them that I hate flying. I hate the crowded airports, the security lines, and fear takes over my body every time I step on that plane, knowing I’m forfeiting control. It’s just never a good experience.
 <br><br>
I had some friends that took the train from San Jose to Vancouver last summer, and it sounded like the time of their lives. Not only did they enjoy Vancouver, but they got to bond so much during the train ride and viewing towns along the way. I absolutely want to try a trip like this someday, travelling the country in a way that allows the journey to be a part of the vacation. When do you ever really have fun on an airplane? I think if we are able to emphasize that the journey is more important than speed, I truly think slow travel could have a huge surge in interest. Plus, once more people buy into the idea, infrastructure for trains and bikes will have to increase along with the demand for it.

Before I began to watch this lecture I took a little bit of pride in myself as I have only flown on an airplane one time in my entire life. Although I had this pride it quickly went away when Ken began to talk about the slow travel movement as I have also rarely been on a train or a bus. I found it absolutely shocking how much carbon dioxide emissions are released in the upper atmosphere in just one trip from Los Angeles to Paris and back. As I myself am personally not one to fly, I know many people who do quite regularly not necessarily to Paris but to places much closer. What is even crazier is that flying first class is even more costly to the environment even though it is something many people strive for. As Ken said it is often seen as glamorous, but in reality it is much bigger than that. This is intimidating as flying has almost become the norm for traveling to places that are not within a few cities. As Ken said this is by far the worst way to travel, yet it is also the most popular way. The problem with this issue when regarding the climate crisis is that most people know that it is not a clean way to travel but a quicker way. It is not the lack of awareness about the situation, but more so the tendency to not care because it is quicker. As I begin to think about flying in a personal sense, I just cannot help but think how many planes I just see and hear a day. Especially with an airport being right next door it is something that everyone is familiar with because of how convenient it is. Ken made an excellent point when he said that just as in all things we do looking at our own actions is essential to fighting this battle because it is very easy to point the finger at big corporations. We must remember that the fight is not against them, but to save our planet and I personally know I can always do better.  Going back to the LA to Paris flight, it is absurd that this very flight is probably happening every day an unreasonable amount of times regardless of what the Paris accord states of yearly emissions. That just flying first class in this flight makes up for 3 years of carbon emissions is ridiculous. Although flying is typically a travel for the wealthier and privileged China’s flight rate has gone up by nearly 50% and I am sure the same is happening around the world. Ken has laid out an important solution to this issue like slow travel which I believe is crucial to helping save our planet. 
 <br><br>


I know I personally will heavily consider Ken’s advice about traveling as I continue to live my life as environmentally friendly as I can. It is rather helpful that I already do not fly often as it is and I only take about one vacation a year. I do however can see how some may struggle as family can be far away to slow travel in between the shorter breaks in life people may have, but it can always be done. As I have now learned the past two weeks how good trains are I will definitely be considering that as an option every time I choose to travel, especially trips up the coast as I am sure it is absolutely stunning. I was happy to know that technology is definitely a helpful way of not always having to travel as I tend to use technology to reach out to those who are farther away. I truly hope that in the near future the slow travel movement will continue to expand and be used by the majority of travelers year in and year out.

The shock on my face when I heard the statistic of “Only 1 in 20 people have been on an airplane” was complete disbelief. It is still hard for me to believe now because it just didn’t seem right to me, yet it is true. I’ve never seen flying as a luxury (everything other than 1st class), but is the most prestige thing a person can do. In my personal experience, I have only been on a plane a couple of times in my life, but now that I live so far from home, that is considered the easier route. I already have flights scheduled to go home and come back for spring break. It is absolutely crazy to me that flying is such a detrimental issue to the Earth. Of course I knew it had its repercussions, but I didn’t know that it is one of the main causes of the climate crisis. However, I do believe that the real fault lies in the hands of the 1%. The rich’s popularity of private jets and helicopters to fly to a place that is easily accessible by car is what have accelerated our forthcoming doom. Kylie Jenner flying her private jet to Las Vegas from LA (which is a 4 hour drive) or using their private helicopters to go from place to place in LA because they don’t want to sit in traffic like a normal person is mindblowing. When Ken was talking about this in the video, it felt wrong that he continiuously blamed regular people for their choices when we actually aren’t the problem. Me going on a packed, cheap flight from LA to Sacramento is not the same as a leisure private jet flight from inner city to outer. Maybe we need to stop blaming ourselves and put it in the hands of the people who are actually causing it.

This lecture did stress me out initially. I have family in Spain and tend to fly there a lot to visit them. The slow travel movement wouldn’t really apply to those trips, and I initially wrote it off, but then I thought more about it. I take other trips, not just the annual trip to Spain. I often go to places such as Arizona, Palm Springs, San Francisco, and Las Vegas with family and friends for smaller vacations a couple times a year. These trips could be achieved with the slow travel movement mentality, but it had truly never crossed my mind that there were other options besides flying or driving. This is the problem. We need to change our entire mindset. I am guilty of not taking other options into consideration and writing off the possibility of changing my lifestyle for the good of the planet. Ken addressed this at the end of his lecture video, when he acknowledged that most people would not take what he was saying very seriously and that it would require a mindset adjustment. I agree that we need to change the way that we think. This is a daunting task, especially in America where we are set in our ways and do NOT like to be told how to do something or worse- that we cant do something. I have some hope that the American people will see how serious our climate crisis is and decide to make the necessary lifestyle adjustments, but it will take a tremendous effort and education of the public.

Just as you said, this lecture did make me feel conflicted. I have family in India and although I have not seen any of them in 5 years because of how expensive the plane ticket is, it seems as though there is no other solution or alternative to flying. Getting to India by boat is somewhat ridiculous but it makes me wonder if we only think that's abnormal because of what society percieves to be "normal". I do feel guilty just like you, taking all these trips is increasing our carbon footprint and slowly killing our home. I really will try from now on to find more effecient and enviromentally friendly ways to travel because this really really opened my eyes. The only way we can better American transportation is if we decide to implement change


<br><hr>

I agree with both of you.  I value travel tremendously and have dreamed of the many places I wish to visit in my lifetime, but I'm not sure if I could justify to myself morally that flying is okay after knowing all of this information.  It shocked me that all of my efforts (eating a plant based diet, buying secondhand, etc.) would be absolved by just one flight.  I liked Ken's story about traveling by train to New York and then flying into London, cutting his air travel time in half.   This stuck out to me, as I could travel to all the places I want to while being as ethical as I can.

·      Professor Hiltner’s lecture on flying really resonated with me because I am an out of state student, so I fly at least 6 times (with a connection per trip) a year just to get to and from school between breaks. Which makes me question what is less harmful, taking a round trip to your destination or having connections along the way? (Maybe they are equally as bad?) Sometimes I fly more than that if we have family trips, but in a single year, I have flown upwards of 10 times. It kills me because I know that flying is horrible for the environment, but I have no other choice, if I want to go home I have to fly there. The only thing that made me feel better was learning that flying coach is the best thing you can do when flying because first class is twice as bad for the planet. Although that fact doesn’t help much because I have been trying to change my ways in order to reduce my carbon footprint. I constantly think “is there a more environmentally friendly option,” or “how can I improve how I do blank,” I am always questioning my actions, yet here I am consistently fly every year. I enjoyed hearing Hiltner’s three suggestions on how to reduce our flying habits, unfortunately none of them really make sense for me to do since I am not traveling for business, and biking would take me the length of the break. I do wish all of these celebrities who take private jets would take the time to realize how horrible it is for the environment. It isn’t hard to take commercial flights, and they could set a great example to America showing that they truly care and want to make a difference. Celebrities have huge followings and people really pay attention to their actions.

Flying really helps us save a lot of time. From N.Y. to London, it takes days by ship and only 6 hours by planes. For business people, time is definitely precious. Planes not only carry passengers but also cargo. It accelerates the progress of the society. We can also see that it can produce a lot of CO2 even for a single flight. Flying habits are hard to change especially for long haul flight, but we can reduce flight times when we travel to closer cities. For instance, many cities have speed trains right now, and we can rather choose to take trains. Also, you should not worry too much about planes' pollution in the future because plane companies like Boeing and Airbus are putting a lot of effort into developing more environmental-friendly aircrafts which can reduce huge amount of carbon emission.

As Ken said in the video, I too, was shocked to see that airplanes only made up a couple percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions; and even crazier than that, if I were to be put in a room with nineteen other people, statistically, only one of those people would have been on a plane. It draws me back to the sentiments of “climate justice” and just how a large part of the world is getting flat out, screwed over because of the top 1%. It truly puts it into perspective, how luxurious it is to be able to fly. However, it raises concern, as I wonder just how governments would be able to effectively regulate emissions or maybe offering monetary incentives, such as reduced taxes for those that decided to travel under a certain threshold via flights. I think the concept of utilizing technologies that make it easier to consolidate meetings and similar affairs is a great idea because it allows for even speedier communication, however admittedly, it would decrease the personal touch that a normal face-to-face conversation would be.

I feel very guilty writing this comment, but I want to be transparent with the class about my travels. My family lives in Taiwan, and in order to see them, I need to ride a 13-hour nonstop flight from LAX to Taiwan. I make 4 round trips in one year (once for each quarter). I cherish my family dearly, so I am not planning to lessen my trips before I graduate. In addition, my parents sometimes come visit me in the middle of the quarters because they want to see me and also love Santa Barbara. If you add up my parents’ trips to America, my trips to Taiwan, my brother’s and father’s business trips, I don’t even want to imagine how many hours of flight time that is. But, what can I do about it? My family and I decided that my parents would visit me maybe once or twice a year, but I will not stop going back home. I wish there was another way for me to not pollute so much but still travel across the globe. Travelling by ship is ideal, but we can all agree that it is not realistic (at least of right now). 
 <br><br>
Travelling is very necessary, for the sake of international students, travelling businessmen, and international organizations such as the UN or WHO. Therefore, I believe that an important next step in combating the climate crisis is creating either more efficient airplanes, or developing the sea travel industry. I know that people will support green airplanes more, as people value time over anything.

Although I know that flying is the single most harmful action to the environment, in terms of carbon emission per flight and per person, this is one of those situations that I feel most powerless. In terms of carbon emissions of cars, fast fashion and even diet, I can adapt and in fact have already adapted. However, as an international student from Canada, it's exceptionally difficult to find a way around flying. And even the options listed in the video regarding finding alternative ways to subdue flight time, such as taking a train or riding an electric bike, can't really be of help in my situation. Hence, my only way to combat flying is simply having the knowledge of what flying does to the environment. Having the weight of this knowledge on my conscious, I can decide to flying when It's truly needed and deserved. 

 <br><br>

In the near future, hopefully airline companies will offer new environmentally responsible inventions. As someone who is stuck in the difficult dilemma between going back home to see my family and living with the consequences of emitting tons of carbon into the atmosphere, I feel the immense urgency for an invention that will take away the guilt of simply going back home. In the future, I could  imagine a flatter aircraft that maximizes the surface area of the aircraft, which will allow maximum exposure to the sun. However, there are obvious problems that come with my model. How will the aircraft receive solar power at night?  How will the aircraft fly in gloomy weather conditions? I don't have the answers to either questions. I am just putting my two cents out there. I truly hope that engineers will look into alternative ways to fly and allow me to go back without guilt.

Anybody correct me if I’m wrong but I do not think that if airplanes had solar panels on top that it is a problem for when they fly at night as long as it was sunny during the day because isn’t that how solar panels work in general? The ones people put on top of their houses, don’t solar panels collect the solar energy during the day but are able to store some of that solar energy so that it can be used during the night? Again, I could be wrong. But I do agree there needs to be changes to the aircraft industry to be more environmentally friendly than it currently is. Hopefully one day soon we can discover this science. I have no answer for if there is a gloomy day, I am assuming the same for when it is night and the solar panels might be able to store the solar energy from maybe the day before when it was sunny. However, I do not know what would happen if we did not get sun for a while or the states that actually go through the seasons so when it snows during winter what would happen. The snow might fall on top of the solar panels and block the possibility of the sun hitting it. Just like you I do not have all the answers.

I think the methods that we traveled are somehow determined by many other factors, such as time and budgets. When we are in a hurry, we have to use the fastest transportation like the airplane. When our budgets are limited, we have no choice to use the affordable one. And, society itself can be a limitation. In this competitive world, every second is valuable. If travel is purposeful, people will seek the most efficient way.  However, when it comes to a relaxing trip without any limitation, I think the slow travel method will be a fantastic way that reduces the carbon footprint and has a great experience. Just like the lecture said, the process of travel is important. 
 <br><br>
Therefore, people will organize their travel prioritizing those limitations. When there are no such restrictions, slow travel can become an environmentally-friendly choice.

I think it's really shocking about how detrimental flying is despite it being only 2% of global greenhouse emissions. The fact that flying can completely nullify a person's change in environmentally conscious lifestyle is insane. I could be a vegan minimalist, but once I get on that plane I am technically the world's worst planetary citizen. As I learn more in this class, I can't help but feel like we're all going to die. It seems almost impossible. In previous comments in this class, I said we can start small and hope that these small changes slowly become a trend and everyone participates. In return, the next generation will be conditioned to follow and change even more and therefore with each generation we revert back to being minimalistic or simplistic and more environmentally conscientious.  But for this to work, I feel like major changes would have to be made regarding the banning of digging for more oil and banning fast fashion and we shop from only thrift stores now. I feel like at this point, only major changes will matter, we are so far into this climate crisis, small changes seems just not enough. I read how small changes in reducing carbon footprint will help, but the fact that flying nullifies all of that...Maybe I am being pessimistic but it just does not seem like we can win. At first I remained hopeful, but knowing the facts of where our CO2 comes from and how consumerism/capitalism is almost embedded into the minds of people (at least in the US or other first world countries), it's disheartening and discouraging. I think our small changes would only work if we were to ban planes and cars and other big and seemingly essential things in our lifestyle.

The more I watch these videos the angrier I get. Lol. I'm like actually livid and so beyond frustrated, that no matter what we do, we are seemingly incapable of lowering our carbon footprint. Takes one round trip flight? 3 tons of C02. Flies once? You're in the elite 1%. This class is making me feel like we are so beyond royally fucked, yet politicians in D.C. continue to deny the mere existence of human-caused climate change. What can we do to fix this? Vote. Go vote like your life depends on it, because it does. It may seem hopeless. It may seem like we can't do anything. But we can. We can vote. We can carpool. We can go vegan. We can thrift shop. We can adopt. We can do so much to save our planet. It just takes effort.

I agree with your comment, no matter what we do, we’re always emitting tons of carbon into the atmosphere. It almost seems hopeless. I don’t fly often, actually in my 19 years of life, I’ve been on a plane a total of three times. Yet I feel terrible for it, as I now know the consequences of those flights. But if we were to truly place responsibility for this kind of CO2 emissions, I think the “elite” should take lots of responsibility. Flying is environmentally devastating, yes, but what's worse - a commercial plane with 100 passengers of a private jet with only 4 people. Yeah, I think that if we’re going to place blame, these socialites or wealthy people are contributing more than the average american. 
 <br><br>

However, that being said , I do believe that the slow travel movement could be huge. I’ve been on quite a few vacations and one of my favorite parts of a trip is the journey. Taking time to see what the city has to offer, or just simply walking around with your loved ones. Slow travel could not only be more enjoyable, but it can expose us to so many new experiences. I definitely want to try slow travel - I have family in San Francisco and I would love take a train to SF.

After watching this lecture video, I did not realize how flying as a mode of transportation was such a detrimental effect on our environment. I liked how Ken didn't belittle someone if they use air travel and told us to avoid it completely, instead he offered other solutions that even still included air travel. Although some solutions, in my opinion, aren't that effective. I honestly am so impressed and salute those who are able to travel days by bike as a mode of transportation because that takes so much patience, time and effort to plan out. I would've never thought that as a solution but anything is possible I suppose. I also really liked the fact that Ken suggests planning a grand vacation instead of a vacation every year. 
 <br><br>


Watching this video made me think of politics all over again. Those who fly regularly and first-class resemble those who are in power/politics and those who fly every now and then or haven't at all are those who aren't part of the boomer era. This is because those who fly regularly are contributing to the climate problem. It isn't fair to those who haven't flown at all because they aren't contributing any CO2 emissions via airplane. Similar to the situation with the boomer generation vs. the current generations after it. Especially those who can afford to fly via airplane, the wealthy and those who even fly with their own private jets. The thing is that climate change doesn't know the word fair. It will affect everyone the same. This is definitely making me rethink my modes of transportation and what I do on a daily basis.

I agree with you that it is not fair for the people who don’t contribute to climate change that much but take much the consequences of those trouble makers. Yes, a lot of politicians and wealthy people take the first-class regularly, which upsets me too. Short distance travel within a country can be reduced if we can take the train instead. There is something that we could do to reduce air travel. I also think that some of the solutions ken provided are not that effective. Nevertheless, I believe that different airlines could collaborate to put travelers in the least plane at the most capacity. For instance, several airlines are going from Shanghai to NewYork, but not all airplanes are packed. Therefore, we may think about getting most people in the least number of the plane, which reduces the emission.

This is the first time that I have different opinion to Ken’s idea. It is true that air traveling is the most environmental disastrous way to travel because to emission per person for a flight is far more than any other transportation. However, it is the most efficient transportation. Airplane can bring us to the other hemisphere in just less than day, while other transportations might take weeks or months to do so. Airplane have made global development more convenient and effective. I agree with Ken that sometimes the most important part of the journey isn’t the destination itself but is enjoying its process. But sometimes people’s objective are very emergency and can only be achieve by getting to their destination. Airplane can do much better than other transportation to help them achieve their goal. Ken mentions that flying is the worse thing to do to the environment. Although it might sounds snobbish and arrogant, it is sad but unquestionable true that most of the people cannot afford air travel. This is the reason why air traveling has contributed a little and far less than automobiles besides its enormous pollution per human.
 <br><br>

However, I agree that it is necessary to reduce to usage of airplane. Since it is the “worst thing that you can do environmentally”, we need to travel less by plane as soon as possible. Although it might cause inefficient to our life, it is worthy to sacrifice that part to make our environment better.

It's been a while since I've taken a flight. I didn't know air travel would cause this much CO2 emission per person. The most shocking fact is that 95% of people never get to air travel before. I'll consider my options for travel now that I know how much carbon footprint is contributed per flight.I think it's challenging to stop flying since air commercial is so much more convenient.But what we can do is considering alternatives, like Professor Hiltner mentioned making a road trip of biking to places. Another fun fact about planes is that planes now travel slower than they use to be, because flying slower save air industry billions of dollars from less fuel use.

I also agree that the flying statistics are astonishing. It is a great example to illustrate the inequality of climate related problems. Only 5%, 1 of 20 people, partakes in flight on airplanes. That 'top' five percent is contributing in a very unequal way to a crisis that will fight us equally. There needs to be more thought put into how we value connivence versus sustainability. Searching for alternatives is going to be very important as we move through time. The change that will happen also can't come from one source it has to be individuals making changes to their own lives, science making further breakthroughs, and our political leaders truly committing to wholesale change.

After watching this lecture, I feel a little guilty about the ecological footprint of air travel, as I am someone who frequently travels between continents every year. However, I am actually not sure what I can do to reduce that impact. The vast majority of these trips are absolutely necessary, such as my travels to/from school; if there's a more comfortable and efficient method of transportation, I'd naturally choose high-speed rail or long-distance buses over planes, but most of the time that depends on the number of options available. However, there are many factors I cannot control: how efficient airplane jet fuel is, how commercial airlines offset their carbon footprint, and how many luxurious flights the world's top 1% choose to enjoy. 

 <br><br>

I've mentioned this before in other previous comments, but I really think that the U.S. should consider upgrading their railways and trains at least to China's or Japan's level. The Chinese HSR and the Shinkansen are among some of my favorite travel experiences; not only are they potentially cheaper and more comfortable, they also reduce carbon emissions by a large amount. For instance, a high-speed railway between San Francisco and Los Angeles would be revolutionary in terms of cutting down vehicular waste and dramatically improving in-state commutes.

You bring up an interesting point about high-speed trains because I had the same thought while watching Professor Hiltner’s lecture video. Why, in this modern day, have we not advanced our train systems to be at least on par with those in other parts of the world? I looked into this a bit and surprise surprise, it all comes back to money, politics, and greed. In the early 1950’s, when cars were being more widely manufactured, big car companies bought all the city trolley systems and many railroad companies. They took all of these out of service and made it their main priority to put in roads and literally pave the way for the automobile revolution. While that set the stage for the U.S. moving away from public transportation development, it’s all the oil lobbying politicians with big stakes in the fossil fuel industry who kept the U.S. from truly advancing our train systems. By allocating money and resources into developing faster, more fuel efficient forms of public transportation, it would mean draining money and resources from the very lucrative fossil fuel business. What we have to do is find a way to make public transportation as profitable as the car industry or at least incentivize it more than it currently is.

Although yes, flying does release significantly more co2 per person than other forms of transportation, considering that it only accounts for 2.5% of total greenhouse emissions, I would argue that the benefits of air transportation far outweigh its detriments. It all revolves around the concept that time is an invaluable limited resource. Being an out of state student from the east coast, a calculated round trip train ride would be 8 days. That means that when I go back home for spring break, I would be spending 8/10 days of my spring break in a crowded cabin instead of spending that time with my family who I haven't seen in months. With your argument that "life is about the journey, not the destination" I would have to strongly disagree with in this case. I also think people who have jobs that require them to constantly travel would strongly disagree with that sentiment as well. Now considering that air travel only accounts for 2.5% of total greenhouse emissions, I believe that in order to keep the luxury of frequently using air travel, we should offset plane emissions by drastically cutting down emissions in other sectors such as agriculture, ground transportation, and housing. It is impossible for the world to reach 0% co2 emissions, so let's pick and choose which areas and sectors are worth releasing co2 into the atmosphere and which are not worth it. Also, a final note, much research is being done today in trying to create electric powered airplanes and so soon frequent air travel won't even be much of an issue.

Very recently, climate activist Greta Thunberg, sailed from her home in Europe to do business in America. 
 <br><br>

This is the perfect embodiment of what we have to transition to as a society.
 <br><br>

She kept the environment in mind when she travels, and recognizes the damaging effects of air travel. She practices what she preaches. Not only did she sail to America, but she practiced slow travel by also extending her trip in America, savoring her experience. 
 <br><br>

This is a difficult topic to tackle, because so many people rely on air travel. In this classroom alone, there are people who are traveling far distances to get an education here at UCSB. How do we respond to this? Should we a society pressure students to only get education locally? What about people who travel back to home for family? Should we discourage people to stop seeing their families? What about the culture gains and experiences the world gains from having different worldwide tourism? Can one travel back to their homeland for the first time to learn about their heritage? This can be an especially sensitive topic, but can be tackled nonetheless. 
 <br><br>

Different modes of transportation such as boats, trains, bikes, and other forms of mass transit can help one savor and appreciate their trip. Boats can be a solution for cross-oceanic travel. If one wanted to go from SB to SF, one can boat up the coast (I think, I'm not exactly sure how boats work). 
 <br><br>

If one has to fly, just consider flying less often, saying at your destination longer, and traveling as many miles via land/sea first.

It’s amazing that air travel only accounts for about 2% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, however it does make sense.  Air travel is only available to those who are wealthy enough to afford it.  This group of people who are able to fly in planes only account for a very small proportion of the world’s population.  Those who are able to fly typically exploit that privilege by traveling more often and further distances which further worsens the environmental impact.  It is the sad reality that we live in that those who are wealthiest use their power for harm and do so without thinking twice.
  <br><br>

As for travel in general, this is actually something that I have wondered about and found myself struggling for answers, but Ken was able to answer it well.  Lately, I have wondered about how to be environmentally conscious when it comes to traveling.  I love to travel, but I don’t want to have a terribly great impact and further contribute to the climate crisis.  I am glad Ken addressed this because like me, I am sure there are countless others who feel the same way.  Flying less and slow travel are great alternatives to allow people to explore and enjoy new places while avoiding exacerbating their impact.  After this I definitely will find ways to implement this more often when traveling.  The journey is amazing and as such we should not cram ourselves into crowded planes just to get somewhere faster.
  <br><br>

Overall, I love the fact that slow culture is emerging with travel, food, and fashion.  I think that it is amazing and has widespread positive impacts on not only the planet but also for those who are practicing these.  It can give people a sense of accomplishment, feeling self-sufficient and able to locally provide for themselves what they need.  Also, it can inspire creativity within each movement, leading to cultural innovation which is something that we need more of in our society today.  By cultural innovation, I mean through cultural change, people change their practices and lifestyles, leading to the emergence of new cultural norms and practices that become widespread.  It’s time that this slow movement became integrated in our society for a brighter tomorrow.

I agree; air travel seems like a minimal problem compared to other environmental issues, but it is also a reason why global greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to increase everyday. Ken mentioned how we should be looking at the air travel problem personally, instead of seeing it as a large company's fault. Although 80% of all flights are made by just 1% of the people on the planet, it's unfortunate that many do not consider themselves as the 1% when they really are. 
  <br><br>
I agree with your point about how we should implement a slow travel culture in which we sacrifice air travel for longer travel times, and invest more time in exploring different places while traveling to your destination. I like how Ken does admit that this will be difficult to enact at first, but there are ways we can adapt to this. One way, as Ken suggests, is having one grand flight every 5 years instead of flying to go on vacation twice a year. He brings up an example to illustrate this; if one was flying from Santa Barbara to London, instead of going directly from SBA to London, it would be more environmentally friendly to take a train to NY first, and then take the plane to London. This would significantly reduce the amount of carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. Another alternative is telepresence; Ken does admit that face to face interaction is obviously better, but the tradeoff of carbon footprint makes it so much more worth for the planet and against the crisis.

I think a point that you brought up about flying being something only the wealthy can afford is really important. It’s truly infuriating the way in which those who have the money to fly like famous people, influencers, and rich folks are able to fly without feeling any sort of guilt about what they do to our planet. Again, its upsetting that although it is our responsibility too, we have to police ourselves to do better for the environment when most rich people probably don’t care. Like you stated, those who are the wealthiest really don’t think about it twice and abuse their ability to fly all the time, and anywhere. 
  <br><br>
In terms of bettering our traveling habits, I think traveling by train and the slow travel industry are solutions/ alternatives that are doable. I also love to travel but have only ever been on a plane to Mexico twice, and despite that I want to do better. I think traveling by train sounds a lot more fun, and an experience all together. Although I really like planes, and the experience of flying, I am willing to do better because I can. That’s something the rich need to do to because they have all the means to do so as well.

The idea presented before about how we glamorize and have environmental problems culturally ultimately ties straight to this. Being rich and wanting to be rich entitles flying and traveling across the world at leisure. Even I know this is something I aspire to do and want to achieve in my life if I did have the money to do such. It absolutely crazy to think roughly 5% of the world has stepped into a plane due to the cost and luxury of flying in general. It’s sad and almost irritating thinking that flying causes our carbon footprint to skyrocket at a single flight, and this at times is the only means of transportation from place to place. Like the example of flying LA to Paris and how it expends our entire CO2 allocation for a year and a half and double that if flying first class. Astonishing to imagine this impact just going on vacation and enjoying other parts of the world. Being that this is such a problem, I will gladly take means to travel less by air to help the environment.

As much as I wish I could get behind slow travel, I really just don’t see it as feasible quite yet. I grew up across the country from my extended family, often only seeing them for a week at most each year. By adding slow travel to the mix, this week would decrease to just a few days as getting time off work is either an enormous hassle or become unpaid vacation days. I think that Ken’s suggestion of cutting down flying when feasible and taking other modes of transportation on a shorter distance is good advice, but for people that are a large distance from families, cutting out flying completely will never be an option. 
  <br><br>
While I do still fly to see family about once a year, I have begun purchasing carbon offsets to potentially release myself of the burden of those extra tons emitted on my behalf. However, it is unclear how well these programs actually work. Nonetheless, I still send my money that way in the hope of popularizing offsetting for travelers who are in a similar position to myself. I love flying to see family, but I must say if bullet trains became an option, I would definitely look into that as well.

I agree that I don’t think slow travel isn’t really feasible at this current point of time. The biggest issue with that is that we are living in a culture that currently would not provide us the time to make such a long journey, say like you got a job half way across the country and you had to move and be there in person to start working in a short amount of time. Personal travel however, is partially a different story because you have mich more control over the situation (though you probably still would only have a limited time as as well). What is important for personal travel is to try to be mindful of ways that you can reduce your carbon footprint for travel, and slowly transition into the role. Similarly to how people would try out minimalism and then end up giving 3 months in, I don’t think that you should put into your personal “law” that you will never ever under any circumstances allow yourself to get on a plane. I think a much more reasonable (and better long term strategy) is to slowly (slowly being the most important part) to slowly change your lifestyle and make better environmentally friendly choices, or else you’ll just give up soon into effort and not change.

You could guess that flying in a plane contributed to your climate change a lot more than driving, however I had no idea it was to such a degree. The average person emits 4.6 tons of CO2 driving a year, but flying just 24 hours contributes 3 tons of CO2? I had no idea. This statistic makes me very sad as my greatest dream has always been to travel the world in my lifetime, but I do not want to take an infinite number of flights fully aware I am contributing to killing the planet. I hope that there is a technological solution to traveling the world without such CO2 emissions, hyperloop maybe?
  <br><br>


I do not travel by plane that much as it is, but for the entire world to stop flying seems impossible. Too much business is conducted by plane and too many people long to see parts of the world they could not without flying there. There needs to be high speed alternatives otherwise I do not believe people are willing to also give up their time driving across the country or sailing across the ocean. Becoming aware of the effects of flying makes me consider the value of going vegan and buying less clothes etc., I imagine a lot of people who fly are less likely to do these things as it seems negligible in terms of their contribution. Really this lecture makes me only increasingly concerned for our planet, as I really do not know how we are going to get people to reduce their contribution to climate change and reverse these effects on our planet.

I had no idea that flying is so detrimental to the environment. Even if I have a largely plant based diet and do not own a car, flying can  single handedly make my carbon foot print double or triple.

With the continuous development of industry, airplane has gradually become the preferred means of transportation for people to travel long distances. As an international student, I have flown many times, but what surprised me was how much carbon they produced. In the process of obtaining the pleasure of travel and enriching our lives, we have unintentionally caused great damage to the environment. However, it is unrealistic to ban airplanes, we should think about how to solve the problem instead of prohibiting airplanes which will make the society go backward. Maybe one day scientists will invent new pollution-free fuels, but until then all we can do is cut down on unnecessary long-distance travel. Now the technology is so advanced that almost everyone has a smartphone and WiFi everywhere, we can use video calls like Skype instead of long-distance travel.

Before watching this lecture I was completely unaware of just how few people have set foot on a plane before. This is just another sad example of how a relatively small percent of people are causing the majority of emissions. And even worse, everyone on the planet will face the consequences of the actions of these few people despite their innocence in the situation because the climate crisis holds no bias. If we consider all of the celebrities and rich people that take planes as commonly as most of us drive cars it reveals an incredibly distressing amount of emissions that are being made so carelessly, so frequently. It is also quite worrisome that flying is becoming increasingly popular even among working class people all over the world. Just like how the popularity of driving bled from America to other countries, the harmful habit of flying is being spread. America is so often at the root of the problems dealing with consumption and unfortunately many countries follow in our footsteps despite our culture being so detrimental to our planet’s well being. 
  <br><br>


As Ken discussed in a previous lecture, if we are to keep emissions to a somewhat reasonable level we could each only emit about 2 metric tons of CO2 annually. Not surprisingly, taking just one flight from LA to Paris would already emit 3 tons, with first class emitting even more at 6 tons. I was curious about the statistics of people’s purpose for flying and decided to do some research. I found that in a survey from 2017 29% of people were flying for business, 21% for “personal non-leisure” purposes, and 50% were flying for leisure purposes. This study was both somewhat encouraging and somewhat discouraging at the same time. It is discouraging to know that the majority of people are taking flights just for their own personal leisure because it shows how little thought we are putting into our actions on an environmental level. On the other hand this is slightly encouraging because the majority of people do not need to make trips for a serious reason, so if these leisure travellers were to become more aware then the amount of emissions could be cut down quite significantly without even considering business flights. 

  <br><br>

I really enjoyed the concept of slow travel, slow fashion, and slow food because it is an idea I have never considered before. The idea that emissions could be lowered all while introducing a more prosperous economy to small and typically insignificant towns due to slow travel is incredibly encouraging. Coming from a small town I was so glad to see my town slowly grow in popularity as a tourist destination because it introduced so many new job opportunities. The local National Park employed more rangers, restaurants starting hiring more cooks and wait staff, and new local businesses even started to open up. Although my town did not become popular due to the slow travel movement it is just an example of how beneficial this practice could be if more and more people began to take part. This idea also offers a solution for people who want to travel but are concerned about doing so because of the environmental implications. As someone who has barely even left the state, let alone the country, I would love the opportunity to travel someday but I was unsure of how I would do so without feeling selfish and guilty. Now that I know more about slow travel I would seriously consider trying out a trip with this method.

As an international student, sorry but I have to say the plane is my “friend”. Before taking this class, though I know climate change is an urgent event, I don’t know taking flight has so much impact on the climate crisis. I went back to China during Christmas break, spring break, summer break. And I fly to other states during thanksgiving holidays. Before I was happy that I was able to visit many different places, but now I feel guilty by looking at the picture of my trips. 
    <br><br>
  I talked with one of my friends after watching this video that I felt so bad that I always travel between China and the US. My friend didn’t take it seriously, she believed if the travel is necessary, then you are doing the right thing. Though her words do make sense, it still does not remove my bad feeling.

I think unless plane travel becomes too expensive for most people to afford, it will be business as usual for the foreseeable future. Travel and tourism is one the fastest growing economic sectors in the world, partly due to cheaper and cheaper air travel. I simply don't see airline companies raising prices or limiting ticket sales in the interest of emitting less. Unless they are regulated to do so by the government, I don't think the industry will change their practices. Similarly, I don't see consumers changing their practices on a large scale, at least for personal travel. That being said, Ken's point about video conferencing and similar technology is a cogent one. If I were a business traveller, I would much rather Skype in from my home or office than hop on a plane and deal with the hassle of an airport. If greater remote working technology can be implemented, I believe this could make a dent in business travel.
    <br><br>

 As for personal travel, I don't see this slowing down anytime soon. It takes great morals and self control to not go on that dream vacation or not visit your family across the country twice a year because the way you get there is bad for the environment. It is a very small group of people that will be willing to sacrifice flight in the interest of environmentalism. I think the strategy for air travel should be innovation and improvement in efficiency, as I believe the rate of flight is not going anywhere.

From this video, Ken wants to advocate us to take train or even bikes going on vacation instead of taking air planes. Because the airplanes emit gases including CO2, mono nitrogen oxides, etc. which increase individuals' short-term climate impact quickly.  But the fact is that nowadays the number of flights are soaring just in the last few years, which would contribute to the climate crisis a lot. Everyone of us would be a "jet set" as long as we take airplanes. Actually there are many ways for us to reduce our use of airplanes, even though sometimes we have to rely on it to cross oceans, we could take other means of transportation on land and try to minimize the distance that airplanes travel.  Ken repeats that "air travel could be doubling or tripling our personal footprint", so that we are supposed to pay attention to three things: business travel, recreational travel and both. Having reminders of what we should notice, I believe that we will do better in reducing our own footprint.

I agree that being more aware of the costs of our actions will help us to change our ways for the betterment of the planet. It was an intriguing idea about “slow travel” that Ken proposed to fix the issue of over-flying. My mindset about traveling has always been to take the quickest means possible (within affordability) to get to a destination, and the journey would begin once arrived. However, the way Ken has suggested it makes much more sense, not only for the planet but for the appreciation of our lives. Rather than taking such a short route, we can take a longer, slower, and more environmentally-friendly form of transportation, allowing us to begin the journey at the start and to appreciate all the beauty that can be seen along the way. This concept can raise our quality of life, along with the health of our planet. Along these same lines, a movement towards “slow fashion” might also increase the personal value we hold for our lives, as, by making our own clothes and using our own efforts to create products for ourselves, we will take more pride in our materials and possibly waste less.

I wasn’t aware of how many downsides there are to flying, even commercially. This is again an issue that I’d pinpoint a product of our cultures’ belief that flying is exclusive or only something the wealthy can take part of. However, Ken breaking down how it is that flying on a plane has an effect on our environment regardless of how frequently you do, definitely opened my eyes to why this means of traveling is so problematic. As someone who has always been interested in traveling and getting out there to explore, I’m glad you mentioned the positive impacts on ourselves and the environment that “slow-traveling” has. Just as slow-food, I too think that these more sustainable methods of traveling can be a cultural force if we emphasize the many upsides that “taking your time” can have when getting to your destination. I’m originally from the Bay Area where my family continues to live so whenever there is a break or long enough weekend I have made my way up there by bus. Believe it or not, the option is not much cheaper than flying commercially but I make use of my time on the bus/train by catching up on tv or film I hadn’t had the time to or finish up homework before arriving. I much rather a 7 hour bus ride than the hassle of waiting for a flight, bag checking and flying for a total process of about 4 hours. Yet, whenever mentioning to people that I take the bus and train back home it seems they assume I don’t have the “ability” or “means” to take a flight. It’s so important for us to realize that there will be no massive changes in our commute / public transport system if there aren’t people taking advantage of them. If no money is going in, not many positive changes can be brought about on their behalf.

I agree with you, I'm from central California and whenever there is a long break or long weekend I go back home on the bus which takes four hours when it usually is a 2 hour drive in a car. However, like you said I also use that time to catch up on homework, relax and destress or even catch up on much needed sleep for those hours. Whenever I tell friends or peers that they also react the same way as what you previously said; as if it was a major inconvenience for me. In actuality, I really enjoy having those extra seemingly slow hours to myself because everything else in my life goes so fast and I am always looking toward the next upcoming event or exam that before I realize the quarter is over. I personally have never been on a plane but I always did want to travel to other countries and see the world so this video was a bit off-putting but there are other options like he stated and I have always wanted to take the train across the country and experience that so it isn't all terrible. Perhaps in the future there will be other ways to travel globally without doing damage to the planet because global travel is major in the business world that it would be incredibly difficult to stop.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you when it comes to the benefits of traveling via train or bus. I also take the train home and it is so relaxing seeing the beautiful sunset and the ocean while I am on the way back home. Although it does take more time than driving in a car or flying, it makes so much more sense environmentally and is a lot less stressful overall. I think that the idea of slow travel will catch on similar to slow food has because it can be a trend people will want to join. Traveling from a few days by train or bus can be really cool because you can stop at places you never even knew existed and create new experiences that would never have happened if you just drove or flew to your destination.

I never really realized the impact flying has on the earth and especially when Ken mentioned the statistic that air travel accounts for 2.5% of global carbon emissions, while making cement accounts for 5% I thought that it makes no sense that flying is so bad for the environment. But, when putting the numbers together and seeing that we should only be emitting 2 metric tons of CO2 per year and one 24 hour air travel from LA to Paris and back would account for 3 metric tons of CO2 (or 1 and a half years of your CO2) I was astonished. This is extremely dangerous especially when it comes to business workers who fly more than once a month. No one really realizes their own carbon footprint has a huge impact on the earth because they think they are so such a small part of a world with 7.7 billion people. But, we living in one of the richest countries in the world, don't realize that 19 out of 20 people have never stepped foot on an airplane and ultimately we are the ones to blame for the rising temperatures and overall climate change worldwide.

I really didn't realize how privileged I was to be able to fly. I was so blind to this that I didn't realize flying only contributes to 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. I figured, "given the number of people who fly and the amount of energy it takes to build and fuel planes, it must be a larger number"... I admittedly am guilty of having a flight scheduled to another state in the US, but I think it'd be quite difficult to switch to a slower mode of transportation, as it would not fit into my time frame of spring break. I do, however, plan to actively consider alternative (and slower) possibilities the next time I plan a trip. This time constraint prompts me to also consider the limited ability of the average American to take longer trips, as we have a limited amount of breaks and holidays each year. If we had more paid holidays, for example, it would be more feasible to take that kind of time to travel more sustainably.

On the contrary to why Ken said that he would lose us with air travel, he lost me with “air travel only accounts for 2.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions”. Yes, I believe this is a great issue of privilege and equity, with the wealthy undoubtedly causing the vast majority of emissions, however, with this statistic, it almost seems unimportant on the true scale of the climate crisis. With the grand impact of things like agriculture, electric generation, and ground transportation, I would frankly prefer to see more emphasis on finding solutions to these issues which truly make up a greater part of our climate crisis, than something which simply doesn’t. I’m not negating the importance of reducing our aviation emissions, but we should be focusing on the issues with the greatest impact due to the timescale of the climate crisis.

After watching Hiltner’s lecture, I felt like an extreme hypocrite. I do consider myself an environmentalist, as much of my lifestyle is centered around living in an eco-friendly manner and I am an active member in various environmental organizations. However, I am an out-of-state student, meaning that I do travel to and from school a lot. The distance is not short, as I typically fly from Chicago O’Hare to LAX. After watching this video I realized as a frequent or even occasional flyer, this cancels out all of the efforts I make in my daily life, along with all the hard work I contribute to Surfrider, Isla Vista Compost Collect and Isla Vista Trading Post. I now feel obligated to rethink the ways I travel across far distances and while diminishing the number of times I travel by plane per year. As a frequent flyer, I am not only the global elite, but I surpass that the statistic of 19/20 people that have ever traveled via train. I used to think that I had a much smaller carbon footprint than most of my friends, who live and go to school in California, but boy was I wrong! This definitely puts my life into perspective, and makes me realize that I do have a heavy ecological footprint despites my dedication to minimize it.

I too was immensely surprised by the number of carbon emissions an airplane releases. Fortunately, I am not a frequent flyer and usually use the Amtrak to commute back home. I can understand why people like flying as it shortens the distance and time between ourselves. However, Hiltner offers a practical transportation method to use both a train and airplane to minimize your carbon footprint. We must consider these specific findings because more and more people are beginning to fly. Slow traveling movement is not practical I believe because it takes the most important human currency: Time. Electric biking and staying in Air BnB is too expensive. I do believe that we can start to utilize trains more though as they are quite affordable and can take you for long distances.

While, as you mentioned, the global significance of air travel is only 2% of the total contributions to green house gases in our atmosphere, it is wildly hypocritical to believe that it is ideologically consistent to travel by plane. We find that the average CO2 emissions per person of a 24hour flight is about 3 metric tons, 1 whole ton over the recommended annual limit to an individual's greenhouse emissions.
    <br><br>

If many of us took to transitioning to more efficient modes of transit, there could be a future in which our public transit finally catches up with countries like Japan, England, China, etc.  This has been something I have honestly dreamt about since sophomore year of high school. I definitely respect the sense of individuality that one feels by owning their own car, but we find that it horrifically breaches the personal CO2 threshold if we were to satisfy the Paris Agreement.

I myself have been reluctantly taking the Amtrak for any long distance traveling that I do. Why am i reluctant? Because the current infrastructure is abysmal if we consider what is possible.

Wow I found this lecture incredibly eye opening to the prospects of flying. Before this class, I always assumed flying would be environmentally friendly such as other mass transit like trains. Safe to say I was wrong. The fact that nearly one flight could double or even triple our carbon footprint is astonishing. It's even crazier to think that there are airports all across the world having planes enter and exit 24/7. Even here in Santa Barbara, I hear at least 2 to 4 planes entering and leaving the airport daily. Relating back to the previous lecture, I feel like this once again comes back down to our transportation infrastructure. Ken mentions celebrities and those of high economic status being able to fly but really who could blame them. If the cost of flying for these people of wealth is really very little, then why wouldn't they opt to travel at such high speeds. Kens example of San Francisco proves this idea. Yes, some people find value in the journey like Ken mentioned, but for most people the end goal is to get too SF. So then why would someone who could easily afford it opt to take an 8 hour to nearly 3 day trip when they could just hop on a plane for 30 min. I believe this drastic difference in time is what really ends any idea for people to not take the plane. Therefore, our transportation infrastructure needs too greatly improve if we are to convince people not to fly. Then came to mind the proposal of the bullet train that never got built here in California. The high-speed train was supposedly going to be able to get you from LA to SF in about 2 hours and 30 min. This development would surely get more people onto trains and off planes as the increase in time is not so drastic. I believe improvement to high-speed rail will surely reduce the amount of people who take planes and thus reducing our carbon emissions. Hopefully this does happen in the near future, because I feel like if you told a random person about to get on a plane the cost of their flight and offered them to take the trip by train they would still decline. We have seen all quarter that many people (Americans) are very short sighted and do not weigh the problems of the future, therefore in that moment they would easily opt for the 8+ hours of saved travel time and use it to spend time with family, business, explore, etc.

Well said, champ. I agree with you on the fact that better means of transportation should be implemented in scenario like traveling from LA to SF to incentivize people to travel in a way that minimizes carbon footprint but also conveniently. At the end of the day, people have different values and will take different approaches to reach a same goal, some people might value experiences more and therefore prefer taking more time exploring along the central coast whereas some people value time more and will just take a direct flight instead. Not everybody might be resolved to pick the option that produces the least amount of emissions, but if we could increase the number of options (in this case the different ways of getting around) that have various costs and benefits, then people may be inclined to pick options that produce less carbon footprint. We would at least eliminate some emission released than when people only have two options.

<br><hr>

I have always known about the huge carbon emissions that plants release into the atmosphere. It’s not hard to imagine all the fumes released into the air when this thousand pound object somehow flies into the air. However, it is very hard to avoid taking planes. For me, and my family it was the only way to get to vacations without taking a cruise, or another way that would take days and days, longer than my actual vacation! There’s no way to appreciate earth’s beauty without taking a plane in many cases, which is very ironic. However, when I go home I do take the train or carpool with other people. The plane from SoCal to SFO takes about 30 minutes, and for me the drive is about 6 hours depending on traffic. I definitely see the appeal of taking the plane, with 5 hours and 30 minutes saved, giving people the time to do what they want in their day instead of just sitting in traffic. This time and convenience that planes provide are the biggest appeal for short trips like these. I completely agree with Ryan when he says we need better infrastructure, because with more efficient roads and less traffic we could save more time driving. If we saved more time driving, it would lighten the contrast of times between taking the train/ carpooling and planes, making many people consider driving and sacrificing a couple hours for the environment. 
<br><br>
 I believe a big part of the popularity with planes is that people see the convenience, safety, and the views without seeing how big of an impact it has. There is no visible impact and the fact that it's a big contributor to the climate crisis is not publicized at all. Many celebrities that are looked up to, including Kate Middleton, regularly use it as a form of transportation, and are always photographed walking out of their planes looking fresh and happy. I believe the prominence of planes in the media with celebrities are a big part of why normal people like us think it's okay to take one. However, attention was raised when Greta Thunberg refused to take a plane or other forms of transportation and instead sails to reduce her carbon emission. This drew a lot of attention to both her, her stance, and especially how bad flying is. Sadly, not everyone cares enough nor has the means to sail wherever they want to go. People should use planes as their last option transportation instead of choosing it first. Then, they could still go where they want to go but also be a little more efficient for the environment while sacrificing a little bit of comfort and time.
<br><hr>
Totally agree with your point of it being valued in our culture. I feel like with any celebrity (athlete, actor, singer, politician) that there is a vivid scene of them exiting a plane to greet fans with media coverage all around. Our culture needs to stop idolizing plane travel as it will only convince the general public that this is what we should do and make the issue even worse. On top of that, I think that companies need to focus more on trains as a way of shipping packages as well. I remember driving to LAX once and seeing a whole bunch of FedEx and UPS planes coming and going. I feel like if they were able to do the logistics and manage to ship packages through train they would reduce many of their carbon emissions and do the world a service. We love to support companies when they "go green" such as using more environmentally friendly packaging which is great, but why not take it a step further by encouraging them to ship by train to save the environment. Again though, this comes back to our culture as many people do not realize the damage planes are causing to the environment, so for now they will continue to urge for changes from plastic to paper and things of those nature.

I always thought that air travel was probably a major contributor to CO2 in our atmosphere, but I knew never it was as serious as it really is. The fact that a flight just under 24 hours can put enough CO2 in the atmosphere that is equal to 1.5 the amount of CO2 the Paris accords is trying to alot each person. 3 tons of CO2 is an absurd amount compared to the amount produced by traveling by things like trains. It is scary. Like Ken said. Only  the wealthy travel by plane. 1 out of 20 Americans have been on a plane, so what happens when even 15 of the 20 start traveling by plane, not even mentioning people who live outside of the US. As Ken stated, CO2 in the atmosphere is only caused 2% by plane travel which should still set off alarms considering how few travel by plane and how relatively new plane travel is compared to most forms of travel. As someone who has traveled by plane, I understand the allure of getting from point A to point B as quick as possible while having  a beautiful view of the terrain below. The fact is that we won’t have that beautiful Earth to appreciate from the sky above if we continue our current rate of CO2 production. Not only this lecture, but past ones all go back to the problem with us, as a society, always falling back on our want for convenience. If it isn’t the most convenient way, we will make it convenient at the expense of others and our very planet. I believe Ken is also when he says the solution is expanding other industries. By expanding train travel, more jobs will be created to replace those lost by decreasing air travel. Also, people will see and visit more of the country, bringing business to places where a lot of people don’t travel through, spreading wealth across America. There are always solutions, the only thing that matters is our willingness to look for answers.

I do not consider myself a frequent flyer. In my life I have probably averaged less than 1 flight per year. However, I now realize this is much more than the average person on this planet. In addition, this has definitely contributed to my greater-than-allotted carbon emission quota. Unfortunately, I don’t believe my flying habits will change too much in the future.
<br><br>
I will be flying to Seattle, WA this summer for an internship, and will not be taking an alternative form of transportation. I simply do not have time to bike up despite the appeal that Ken presented in the video. Unlike what Ken said, I do not enjoy train rides and do not find them relaxing. I would much rather be cramped on an airplane for a couple hours than sit in an enclosed train car for an entire day.
<br><br>
I will however consider other options for closer travel. In the past, I would consider flying as a means of getting from San Diego to the Bay Area. Now, I will definitely be more receptive to other means of transportation like buses of trains. Unfortunately, Amtrak is very unreliable and disproportionately expensive.
<br><br>
I am not supportive of focusing on air travel. Even though it may be one of the largest factors impacting one’s carbon footprint, it is not a large proportion of total carbon emissions. I believe it would be more beneficial to focus on other aspects of one’s life, given that most people will also make that change.

As someone who has never been a flyer and wants to potentially partake in this form of traveling, I have questioned by wants due to the amount of harm flying does to the environment. It is in fact the worst way to travel.  Ken mentions that by deciding to travel through this method 3 tons of Co2 are released into the environment. With a number as low as 2% for the amount of total CO2 in the atmosphere, but this 2% is very crucial. We often get excited in the actual action of being able to experience a new experience, that we forget the impact to the environment traveling by plane has. We seek out this experience because people in power often decide this method of travel and have created an extremely positive connotation being able to ride a plane. It has gotten to the point where people want to own their own plane and privatize their travel.  Why do we all strive for this model if it unrealistic and extremely unsustainable for the environment. 
<br><br>


I think its important to consider the alternatives Ken presented. Such as to combine short trips and make travel most effective in terms of CO2 emissions. Through theses adjustments in our everyday lives we are able to cut back on our CO2 emissions and create a better future for the upcoming generations. It is ultimately our responsibility to cause change in our culture and doing this would be a step in the right direction. Also if the one percent would begin to take initiative major change would occur.

"Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally" is really great. I always thought that more people flew planes but only 1% make up 80% of flights. I did not know that flying caused so much CO2 to be released into the atmosphere. With this information, I think it is fair to question the use of private jets. Are those private jets really neccessary? To me, I think we should limit the manufacturing of private jets. 

<br><br>

Trains are a great alternative. I think this country would be happy to have high speed trains that would go throughout the country. We should only fly if we are going to another continent. Well in the Americas, you could make some agreement between various countries and have a railroad system from Canada all the way to South America. Don't mind me, I'm just dreaming.

This lecture made me feel personally called out because I have partaken in my fair share of air travel and it’s such a coincidence, but I am vegan and a friend just invited me to visit her hometown across the country on a first-class flight, so that part of the lecture really hit me. I try to be as environmentally conscious as possible, so sometimes when I drive my car I think, “it’s okay because I eat a vegan diet,” but in this case, with air travel, it sucks to know that the vegan diet is basically cancelled out with one flight. I will definitely reconsider my options for travel and honestly, the slow travel movement sounds appealing to me because as Ken said, it is about the journey, not the destination. I think to be able to enjoy a slow journey says a lot about someone’s outlook on life. Most of us just want to get to our destination as quickly as possible and don’t have the patience, but when we slow down and can enjoy each moment we get a lot more out of life because each moment feels much more indulgent.

I agree with you! I didn’t realize how harmful air travel could be and I am guilty of traveling frequently as well. After watching this video it definitely opened my eyes to the slow travel movement and will start to use that when traveling to other states! This option doesn’t seem to be too bad especially if traveling with friends. I think it would be a great experience to see new things all while making a positive impact on our environment.


<br><hr>

I am also a frequent flyer, but don’t have the desire to travel by other modes. The convenience of flying from coast to coast in roughly six hours is more appealing than traveling by train for 70 hours. Maximizing the time I have is incredibly important to me. Let’s say I chose to travel by train for spring break, which is about a week long. I would spend 3 days on the train, stay at home for only one day, and come back by train to return to school. Like all decisions, a cost-benefit analysis needs to be made. If the destination is my goal, I honestly do not care too much about the journey. If I made the journey to the destination my goal, then riding a train may be a worthwhile investment. This previous example may be extreme as I’m valuing my own convenience over the health of the plant.  
 <br><br>

I was intrigued to learn that only 5% of people travel by air and learning that I’d account for (and go past) my total carbon emissions in a single flight is disappointing. I have family in Greece and I can’t travel there without taking at least one flight. Ken mentions an interesting argument about taking a long vacation every five years versus taking two short vacations that require flying. I disagree with some of the argument. I do think it would beneficial to the planet to fly less, that is a given fact. However, in a culture where people don’t use all of their vacation time, I don’t understand the benefit in taking longer vacations less frequently than shorter vacations more frequently. More frequent vacations would greatly benefit the person’s health, and though all of those vacations don’t need to be done by flying, if flying would allow a person to enjoy their time more in his/her/their destination of choice, then the benefit of improving one’s health would be more important than the benefit of improving the earth’s health. This is tough for me to say because I know this viewpoint is not necessarily the right in regards to minimizing the climate crisis, but as Ken mentioned there are many ways to minimize our impact, a balance between all things mentioned (transportation, housing, consumerism, diet, etc.) may allow leeway for luxuries such as flying.

<br><hr>
Among the things that I am doing to do my part in reducing my carbon footprint, flying wasn't on the list. Slow travel can be really fun with the right person! My hometown best friend and I took a 4-hour bus and a 5-hour train ride to get home and not only was it cheaper than driving, but it was also more fun. I haven't flown in a long time, but I have definitely done my fair share of flying. My family primarily lives in Spain and we used to visit every year. I had no idea the repercussions then, but now I see the problems with flying thanks to Ken and this class as a whole. I agree with you that it's discouraging to be so conscious of everything that you're doing just to have it all canceled out by a single flight.


<br><hr>

I agree with what you said about not knowing just how harmful flying can be, and although I take pride in eating in a more environmentally conscious way, it is completely cancelled out by my history of flying. While I’ve never flown first class, which he stated is twice as bad as flying economy, I have taken more flights than necessary when traveling. 
<br><br>

When I booked a trip to Europe with my best friend the summer after we graduated high school, we wanted to see as much of Europe as we could in the shortest amount of time. The cheapest, and fastest way to travel to all of the countries we wanted to was by flying. We were balling on a budget and the time crunch, and our financial situation didn’t allow us the option to use forms of slower transportation on the trip.
<br><br>

Knowing what I do now, if I were to do that trip again, I would most definitely try to find a way to travel country to country on trains, or stay in one country for most of the trip rather than hopping around.
<br><br>

Like you, slower travel sounds appealing to me as well. When I was traveling in Europe I felt like I was missing out on so much because of how fast-paced my trip was. I agree with what you said about people not really having patience anymore and wanting to get to their destinations as fast as they can. I think if we slowly transition to slower forms of travel, people will begin to appreciate the world around them more than they do now.

It’s undeniable that flying in a plane causes much less probability for an accident to happen than commuting by cars, buses, or other public transportations. However, I felt guilty and sad that I realized that we actually create “2.5% of greenhouse gas emissions” on this beautiful planet. Every day, people come and go. They fly from place to place. What I see is that upper class businessmen or families fly first class so often. For me, I do not spend my parent’s money on flying first class, instead I always choose economy. Although I do not really acquire the difference between the first class and economy class, despite the price of the ticket, I would always choose economy, which already satisfied my need when going to another place. It’s true that people flying first class is twice as bad for normal seating, since it takes up so much space on an airplane, which should be considered when one’s flying a plane for travel. 
<br><br>


Moreover, I would like to talk about a social issue about using transportation according to one’s level of family background. It’s arguable to say that people taking planes instead of train or shuttle buses for business work or traveling are wealthy enough to afford the price and deserve the situation. It doesn't really matter if one is poor or rich to determine the social class of a person. It is one’s choice to take alternate transportation for different ends. We should not create stereotypes of how poor and wealthy classes act or consume differently. As a result, in terms of promoting environmentally friendly ways to live a life, fly less can be a good choice.

This lecture has been very informative and, honestly, surprising. I didn’t know that flying accounted for about 2.5% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. Another statistic that I was shocked by was that “80% of flights are made by just one percent of all people on the planet.” I, myself, have never flown, but I would be lying if I said that traveling the world does not interest me. My whole life I’ve wanted to travel and discover new places. I’m working hard in school to hopefully get a good job that will allow me to pursue this interest. 
 <br><br>
Even after I’ve listened to this lecture, I still want to board planes and visit as many places that I can. I know that does not make me an environmentally friendly person, but why can the rich and famous keep adding to the greenhouse gas emissions by flying first class and taking private jets, and I can’t fly coach to London. Not that I would be such a frequent flyer, but I do want to see the world. 
<br><br>
 I understand the idea of traveling by train or even biking (if that can be done for a trip), but that’s not always an option for every place you want to visit. It’s also not very convenient. I find this problem of flying troubling and I know the price we will pay for all the greenhouse gases we are emitting into the air, but there’s still this voice in me that tells me that this is one dream I can’t give up. 
<br><br>
 I think that if people are to fly, it should not be as frequently or as luxurious, such as private jets. Not that we have to stop flying altogether, but try reducing it.

I can relate to how you feel towards this lecture video as I have never flown either. I never really had to for the reasons others here have stated since all my family lives in California. My mom is terrified of planes and genuinely enjoys car trips so it has never really been a method of traveling for us. I was very surprised to hear the statistics he presented us with which was 80% of travels are done by 1% of people. I guess I should not have been as surprised because I do have family members that travel multiple times a year (4+) either to a new country or to Mexico to visit family friends. I guess we, in the first world, are very privileged to have that option and see it as something normal. 
<br><br>

Prof. Hiltner mentioned slow traveling and I think that is an option that is very appealing to me. One of my uncles also told me that before I settle down and while I’m young, I should take the train across the nation because it is an unforgettable experience. But I do understand why many would not think that it is very practical to do because you need to have the extra time to spare. I know a lot of friends that go to UCLA and prefer flying home to San Jose because it is more convenient and allows for more time with family during our short breaks. It is the convenience of taking a plane and not wasting any time that makes it so attractive to people. As you said, I also wish to at some point travel to countries I am interested in exploring. Not necessarily to as many places, I can, but just take a nice vacation once in a couple of years.

Airplanes should be viewed almost like cars but amplified when it comes to carbon emissions. When I first heard through this lecture that airplanes triple your individual carbon footprint, I was taken back by the fact that it could even do this. I guess we tend to overlook this form of travel because the global society views it less consequential over time efficiency. This really made me realize how knowledge of facts like this helps me become more environmentally aware in the present; I just wish I got an early education on these things in primary school. If we are able to learn about other aspects of health in school, why are we not taught on the earth’s health especially since it will impact us directly? 
<br><br>



Although I haven’t been in an airplane for many years, I can imagine why airplanes which use up lots of gas to travel detrimentally correlates to the expenditure of carbon emissions. The carbon footprint is permanent as the things you do will always change something as no two days are exactly the same. To simplify, transportation gets you places faster but that does not mean it is always environmentally friendly or beneficial other than time efficiency.

It is surprising to me that the air travel releases that much of emissions. But people cannot avoid air travel nowadays. Especially for a country like the US that the air traveling market is so developed and the US has enormous passengers for air travel. And private jet traveling is much prevalent in western countries which is more harmful. As a matter of a fact that each year the number of passengers increases worldwide.
<br><br>


I do agree that air travel releases a lot of emissions, but I also think that it is better now. The newest generation airplanes such as Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 are the most environmental-friendly airplanes. Compared to the last generation like Airbus A330, A380 and Boeing  747, 777, that those new generation twin-engine airplanes reduce a lot of emissions and require fewer fuels and flies longer and longer. Airplane manufacturers as Airbus and Boeing have been working on reducing the airplane emissions for years. And the news generations are able to reduce fewer emissions. However, the old generation of airplanes is still operating in the sky.  Many companies have replaced their airplanes already.
<br><br>


The world needs to connect and air travel is the most direct way. People cannot separate from it now. But our choices can make a huge change. I fly long-distance flights every year multiple times. There are multiple fights or ways from LA back to my city. But I always choose to fly A350 or B787. First, I can fly nonstop with air carriers operates with A350 or B787 back to my city. Second, those airplanes require fewer fuels which means fewer emissions. Again, we cannot avoid air travel, but we can choose how to fly enviornmental-friendly.

<p>
I don’t think the idea of reducing airplane travel can work in this era. I am from China, an international student from the other half part of the earth and I need to back and forth at least twice a year. For me, this idea is like to suggest me to not pursue the higher education opportunity even if my family can afford, and I cannot sit here to listen to ken’s lecture. When in the time that people want to pursue something better, this idea will not be achieved, since this idea simply means that people lose the efficiency. This maybe can achieved decades after, when people get another way of high efficient and environmentally friendly transportation.

Seeing that so little people have actually set foot in an airplane and have flown is quite shocking. My first time taking an airplane was actually when I was in 2nd grade. It is common for airplanes to be preferred because of the convenience and the speed. Because I was travelling internationally, speed is preferred and airplanes make up for that, but to hear that only 1/20 people have actually flown is astounding. Even so, the few that do travel by airplanes are putting out tremendous numbers of emissions. What was more astonishing was the fact that flying first class emits twice as much emissions as those flying coach. I feel that because we can’t physically see the emissions, people don’t think twice about flying first class and coach, with the only restraint on choosing would be financial circumstances. I agree with Ken that there are better ways than flying on an airplane, and the time would have a much more lasting impression. For example, as Ken said he could take the train or bike. Taking a car ride, though it would add time, is a very fun experience especially when taken with friends or loved ones. Personally, I would much prefer being in a rideshare with people that I know than flying alone. Just the fact that I am able to spend more time with the people that I love is incentive enough, and not only that I am able to reduce my carbon footprint and protect my funds too. Because of the convenience of airplanes and the psychological factor of wanting to meet people face to face, I believe the airlines have benefited from it. They are able to make money transporting people and emitting so much CO2 with no repercussions. Honestly, being able to make face calls or make phone calls is so much more efficient.

I know a lot of people who are frequent flyers. It is scary to hear that if they are in a room of 100 people, they are contributing more to carbon emissions than anyone else in the room. It is shocking how quickly someone can double their carbon footprint, and there should be a way to make people more aware of this. I can imagine the outrage if governments imposed a maximum amount of miles flown per year, yet that is a potential way to limit our carbon emissions as a country. 
<br><br>


I will be voting for a candidate who supports a Green New Deal, as we need the government to force people to take action because otherwise people will stay inactive, as people are pretty lazy. If the government enforced something like a carbon tax, airline tickets would rise and people would be incentivized to fly less.

To someone who isn't educated on the effects of air travel, air travel would seem as a "mass transit" option because there's so many people being transported at once. I guess that is the price to pay for such technology that allows us to travel almost 10 times faster than in car. I think other modes of transportation to far off destinations like trains and buses are not used commonly because the average person doesn't have that much time for vacation and therefore wouldn't want to be stuck going to the place they want to go to for 10 times longer. Stopping at other places for shorter times would be a nice change to vacations. It is a good idea to travel mass transit and stop at places for a day and keep on going. It would just require different planning but I could see that this could be implemented for the average person. It's not that big of a change as other things because there are so many places that are hidden gems that one might never have thought to go to.

I have to be honest that, I felt ashamed after watching this video because of my own lifestyle. I am an international student from China here at UCSB, which implies how many long flights I might have taken over the past few years in the U.S. and how many more are coming in the way. When Ken is using examples of flights from here to Europe, I am heading to the exact opposite of the world--Asia. Taking long flights are somewhat important for me because anyway, that's my hometown where most of my family are. However, if there a possibility that I can change the current situation? The answer is "yes". I usually go back home twice a year. Once during winter break and once during summer break. When it's reasonable that I wanna go hoe during the summer because I have three months of vacation, going back during winter break pales in that comparison. For that 20 days of break, I can potentially find ways of having fun without long flights, maybe the one suggested in the video! I do have time to spend a couple of days riding to San Francisco back and forth. And if I can find some friends to do this, I believe that this is gonna be an experience of life time. So after all, flying less and enjoy maybe a slow-styled life more could be very helpful for our environment.

I was surprised that I never thought of airplanes until Ken Hitler said "Airplanes are the worst for the environment." I was thinking in the beginning when he said that airplanes only emit two and a half of greenhouse gasses that airplanes are not bad. But then I realize how far you actually go on airplanes are what caused them to be the worst. My only concern is am I willing to change for this situation. I realize I am more towards privilege because I am 1 out of 20 people to have gone on a plane which shocked me. But, I was able to see my homeland in Japan by taking a plane. Japan is really far so I must have already lost at least 5 to 8 years of my carbon footprint already.  I guess my only alternative is sailing on a boat but Idk if I would be able to do that. 

<br><br>

I do agree with Ken about meeting someone for a business trip. Why don't we just use our phones or laptops to facetime with each other because it is about the same as talking to a person face-to-face. This would definitely reduce people taking a plane to go all the way to the destination of the meeting. But, are bosses of companies willing to face-time or want to see their employees in real life because they want to have their respect.

I completely agree with you and Ken in regards to using face time or phone calls as a method for conducting interviews or meetings. However, in regards to flying, some people really don't have any other choice. Fortunately, I live in the Bay Area (which is about 300 miles away from Santa Barbara) so slow travel is an option for me. I do see myself taking the train to my hometown since it takes less than a day to get there, but as others have mentioned, there are time constraints that unfortunately won't allow me to venture 12 hours up the coast. As for your case, I think it is justifiable to fly to Japan since sailing on a boat is arguably barely any better. Sailing, depending on your choice of ship, can still emit a great amount of carbon emissions. Given that you are a student in UCSB and live on the other side of the world, sailing wouldn't be an effective way of traveling since the quarter system won't allow you to have enough time to even reach your destination. Although we are aware that traveling by plane is detrimental to our atmosphere and is responsible for emitting about 2-2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the use of slow travel is arguably difficult to adjust to when your schedule just won't allow you to. 
<br><br>


One thing I would say is that being that 1 person out of 20 that is able to part-take in air travel (like you) makes me realize just how privileged I am. Never would I have considered myself to be as such, but considering that about 95% of the entire population have not stepped foot on an airplane, I couldn't deny it. I can't help but feel guilty of contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases, but it was ultimately the best choice of travel in regards to time efficiency. Hopefully, somewhere in the near future, we are introduced to more eco-friendly methods of traveling that are more time efficient than slow travel.

As an international student, I am sadly withing the mere 1% of the population that frequently fly, not to mention that most of my flights are across continents. While flying is environmentally detrimental, we have to acknowledge that it is nevertheless the fastest way to travel up today. I fly mostly from China to the U.S since I go to college thousands of miles from my home, so imagine how hard would it be for me to take other means of transportation, traveling by water? Although flying would not necessarily be the best choice considering environmental protection, it is indeed the most convenient way to "commute" in a sense. I would expect more people to set their foot on an airplane in the era of globalization-- people would have to travel by air for business or educational purposes. However, giving the carbon emission of this type of transportation and the uprising trend to fly, things would be more troublesome in terms of the climate crisis. As far as I could think of a way to really solve this problem is teleporting, although the experience of going to an actual college is not likely to be replaced by going to an online college.

Although air travel is the most convenient transportation methods, the carbon dioxide emission per flight directly spread in the upper atmosphere. People who are frequent flyers contribute times compared to occasion flyers. I think the video provide a sufficient data about how air travel is involving of climate crisis. However, I think air travel is necessary for people compares to trans because it could cross oceans that other transportation methods could not done.

Before watching Hiltner's lecture I had a general idea that flying was not environmentally friendly, so hearing all the the stats that overall all it only accounts for about 2.5% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and then hearing that flying rises a person's individual carbon footprint was a little eye opening. As someone who has never flown before I can say I felt a little relieved, but growing I wanted to go on vacations at least once a year to someplace new. I also have thought about studying abroad, but after watching Hiltner's lecture I feel like I'm discouraged to do so in the name of saving the environment. I also feel like flying and traveling is something that has been able to connect people and cultures so I don't see it becoming less trendy anytime soon. The alternatives though that Ken introduced seem very doable and something that most people should consider when it comes to flying. One thing he said is taking a great vacation every five years instead of the one vacation a year which is something I would want to do.

Due to my family’s financial situation, I have not really traveled the world. Because of this, I have also never flown on a plane, also partly because I am gravely afraid of heights. Giving something up that I have never even tried is undoubtedly easy for me. The issue stems from those that use the means of flying as a necessity. Here in UCSB we have quite the plethora of international students. Many have to rely on flying planes to get back home and visit their families during breaks and holidays. I am from LA, so for these situations I can just take the FlixBus or Greyhound. For issues like these, I particularly found Ken’s idea of minimizing air travel interesting. If we cannot evade flying, then we can minimize it by getting as close as we can to our desired location through travel methods that do not emit as much CO2 like buses or trains. For business trips, Ken brings up the idea of a telepresence, where you can be at a conference meeting for example through your phone while actually being at home. I also like how he brings up the slow travel movement. Although it may not be the most practical for our needs, it is definitely the most efficient when it comes to fighting anthropogenic climate change. Slow travel also directly correlates to the importance of prioritizing slow fashion over fast fashion and slow food over fast food.

This epidemic of air travel and it's affect of it on the planet is something that many haven't considered.Yes, it's extremely horrible for our planet, but the thing is that it's been so ingrained into the lives of many. In addition, statements like "air travel is safer than driving" and "you're more likely to get into a car crash than an airplane crash" only reinforce the 1% of flyers and convince them that flying is truly the best option. I personally don't think many frequent flyers realize the amount of stress that is being put on the planet because of air travel. Not to mention, I think an airline's response to a question like, "do you know how much flying ruins the environment?" would be something along the lines of "do you know how many jobs there are because of flying?" or "we've streamlined traveling to the point where one could fly from LA to SF in under 2 hours as opposed to driving for upwards of 6 hours." It's going to be extremely difficult to change the way many people travel, and it only makes me curious as to what solutions would be presented to resolve this issue.

I think it was especially important that Ken noted that the 5% of the people in the world who are flying are setting an example and making other people want to fly. It made me think of Before the Flood when Sunita Narain criticizes the US for setting a bad example in converting to solar energy. The wealthy are inspiring those in lower classes to follow their lead in the worst ways.
<br><br>

I also appreciated that Ken offered multiple solutions to the problem of air travel. He is not saying never travel anywhere that requires flying, but simply saying limit flying in whatever way you can with trains or buses. I've never really travelled by train, but in the future, I will definitely use trains when possible and encourage my family to do the same. 
<br><br>

I really like the idea of slow travel because it actually allows you to see more of the world through traveling. You can enjoy the different places along the way to your main destination, rather than quickly flying over them and not actually paying attention to the world beneath you. I also thought it was important to mention that cutting back on air travel will affect the economy,  but other forms of transportation could make up for this.

The comparison to Sunita Narain is absolutely on point. Western countries are setting bad examples on how to live environmentally. In the media we see rich people and associate flying with success, yet in reality, we are perpetuating such devastating practices for the environment it's heartbreaking. I liked the theory Ken put forth that less time spent traveling to the destination is not necessarily a good thing. If I had the choice between flying and taking the scenic amtrak along the ocean, there's no choice. I'm 6'6" and I barely even fit on a plane. Slow travel is the way of the past, and somewhat ironically, the way of the future; we've come full circle. Cutting back on air travel will certainly affect the economy, but I'd like to point out that the people this cutback hurts most are the airline companies themselves, meaning less supply in the long term, and a healthier earth. The shift toward Earth-healthy transportation will have positive benefits, both economically and socially/culturally towards a healthier Earth.

I agree with the point that we are not saying never travel anywhere that requires flying, but simply saying limit flying in whatever way you can with trains or buses. As an international student, I have to fly a lot, I feel sorry about that because I never knew how much CO2 was cost by me. However, this does not mean I need to quit flying because I need to go home, just like business trip can not be eliminated because of the flying issue. Although I can not eliminate it, I can reduce it. Might be I do not need go home during short holidays like during the winter, that will cut half of my foot print. After landed to my country, I can take the train to my hometown instead of taking plane.

<br><hr>
I agree, I also really like the idea of slow travel. We have gotten to a point with food, clothing, and transportation where we can do things so quickly and easily and this allows us to cram more into our schedules. Adapted to this way of life, most people would dismiss slow traveling for the time it takes. I personally have a much better time traveling slowly than I do quickly. It makes more sense to me that we should observe and be more connected to the path of our travels. People often dismiss things that would help the planet or be good for them personally by saying they don’t have time. We need to change our systems so people can imagine taking time for things. It seems that improving public transportation and biking infrastructure are essential for making these transportation alternatives possible. In many places people can’t safely bike. We need a cultural shift that supports taking time for things and we need to improve our more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.

The fact that stood out to me the most in this video was: "80% of all flights are made by 1% of the people on the planet," that 1% being the wealthiest people or "jet-set." Personally for me being part of the 19/20 people who never got on a plane in their lives, I was honestly looking forward to traveling the world and taking my first trip sometime in the near future. However, at the beginning of this video, I felt ashamed and confused as to what I should do, it's been my dream to travel the world and now Im learning that if I do, I'm only hurting the planet? Once getting to the end, Ken did mention many other alternatives to travel the world without causing that much harm to it. Then I realized that I traveling is about getting to know new places and making memories, which you can't really do by siting in a 24 hour long plane ride, and instead taking overland transportation as much as possible can make a great story and one can see the beauty of life. In fact, my friends and I decided to take a train ride to San Francisco one day, and I can honestly say it made the trip more exciting and we created amazing memories to look back on. 
<br><br>
Moreover, when hearing about what we should and shouldn't do in order to save the planet, most people (including myself) get discouraged and feel like changing our lifestyle is an impossible mission, but I enjoy that we are given alternatives instead of cutting it out all together. And for the most part, these alternatives ultimately lead to a healthier, longer, happier lifestyle than the one we don't want to let go off.

that it is hard to ask so many people to make huge lifestyle changes that will better the environment, but it is encouraging to hear ways in which we can reduce our carbon footprint. I am from a town near San Francisco, so I was curious to hear Ken’s travel tips about coming to and from there to Santa Barbara (I always drive to and from home and school, and occasionally fly). After hearing Ken’s three transportation modes to San Francisco, fly, train, or bike, I basically laughed. Why would anyone choose to give up the luxury of flying quickly from one place to another, only to be spending more money (as opposed to flying) in hotel/homestay bills just to bike all the way from Santa Barbara to San Francisco. That sounded crazy to me. However, the idea of taking a train to San Francisco was not too far fetched for me. This would be  a great way for me to cut down on my personal carbon footprint and avoid flying so often. This was Ken’s idea of “slow travel” and to be honest, it kind of excited me. I could take a beautiful train ride up the coast of California, while also knowing that I am helping my planet along the way. Sometimes, stepping out of our comfort zone and trying something new is a great way to grow and explore. As Ken said, “it’s about the journey, not the destination”.

Flying is often toted as one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind. The fact that it contributes so much to environmental pollution is not only sad but completely and utterly devastating. Does this mean that we have to completely forgo our global lifestyles and live our lives completely rooted in the same area? As Ken points out in this lecture, not necessarily. Taking a larger mega-trip every once in a while is a fantastic way to enjoy a long-distance vacation that would help diminish our carbon footprint. He is so completely correct when he says that life is about the journey and that we often waste too much time focused on things outside the present moment. So often, we lose the forest for the trees and end up wasting so much time thinking about how much time we just wasted. 
<br><br>

Week after week, Ken challenges us to take a flying leap outside our comfort zone. This time especially, Ken presented a challenge to make a real difference. I for one will definitely make sure that I don't frivolously spend my yearly carbon allowance on a measly flight from LA to SF. Compared to a complete diet change, limiting the amount of flights that I take is a much easier lifestyle change to make.

After watching the video “Flying, the absolute worst thing than you can do environmentally,” I was surprised by the fact that there will be nearly three tons of carbon dioxide being emitted per person just by taking a 24-hour plane. In the past, I knew that air traveling only contributed a little to the global total greenhouse emission, therefore, I didn’t pay to much attention to it. However, after watching the video I knew that it will double, or even triple a person’s climate footprint just by taking an air trip. This means that the efforts which people made in other aspects to protect the environment, such as having less beef or living in a small house in the city like Ken mentions in his lecture, will be in vain just because of one single flight.
<br><br>
Another fact which also shocked me is that “air travel in China has increased 50% percent in merely five years.” I used to take travels to different countries by air every vacation when I studied in high school, and now, I cannot imagine how many greenhouse gases I have emitted into the atmosphere just by the transportation that I chose. Also, as an international student who lives in Beijing but takes college at Santa Barbara, and took the 16-hours round trip for holidays, I realized that I contributed a lot to that, and of course damaged the environment a lot unintentionally. Right now, I will seriously consider the solution that Ken provided in the lecture. With the advanced technology, I can use Face-time, Wechat, or other software to connect with my parents, rather than taking a plane back and talking to them face-to-face. For the visit on vacations, I will certainly take Ken’s advice and using the form of “slow travel,” which can not only help me to enjoy the process of travel rather than the destination only, but also doing good for the climate.

I appreciate your comment about the video “Flying, the absolute worst thing than you can do environmentally.” When I heard Ken said there will be nearly three tons of carbon dioxide being emitted per person by taking a 24-hour plane, I was surprised, too. Taking an air trip contributed to a large amount of greenhouse emission, which accelerated the process of global warming. I cannot imagine what I have done to the environment since I took air trips so many times. You mentioned that when you studied in high school, you “used to take travels to different countries by air every vacation.” So I share the same feeling with you. As an international student who also lives in Beijing, I understand your meaning when you said you “took the 16-hours round trip for holidays” and “damaged the environment a lot unintentionally.” I think we have to do something in order to change the situation. Like you have mentioned in the comment, I also decide to follow Ken’s suggestion  and use the form of “slow travel” to reduce our greenhouse emission to the environment.

As I was watching this I couldn't understand why I was getting so frustrated with what he was saying. It seems like such a ridiculous ask. And then I realized I was frustrated because flying is something I never would have considered giving up, and I was angry with myself for being so unwilling to drop such an environmentally degrading action. As an environmental studies major I know that I care about the environment. I'm committing my studies and future to it, I've gone vegetarian, I pick up trash on my way to the beach. I've been willing to make sacrifices, but the idea of giving up something I love so much actually makes me angry with Ken. I don't want to be asked to do this because quite simply I don't want to stop flying. I don't just love the speed of the vessel, but even the action of being on a plane. And it irks me to know that no matter what day-to-day sacrifices I am willing to make, I will never be able to drop the thing that makes me more environmentally degrading than most people. After watching this, I am slightly haunted by what I am and am not willing to give up. That said, I want to use that anger and try to do what I can to decrease my flying impact. This is a challenge that I never knew I was facing until now, and I am going to try my best to combat it in the ways that I can.

Ken mentioned there would be a point in the class where we would all be challenged by something he suggested about climate change, and this is mine. It's not that I don't understand the disastrous consequences of flying; I do. We are literally putting CO2 directly into the atmosphere every single time a plane takes off. And it's not that I don't care because I also really do. All of the ideas Ken recommends for limiting our carbon footprint I have taken into serious consideration and am trying to implement in my daily life. But I am feeling incredibly challenged by the problem of air travel because I love to travel. Up until this last year, I had not traveled much at all, which made traveling seem like such a luxury and something I really really wanted to do. The desire to travel even influenced my choice in major and future career path. I guess I am struggling to wrap my head around how to live a greener lifestyle while also not giving up the idea of ever seeing the world. With driving and eating meat, there are other viable alternatives. It's not that difficult to use more public transport or bike around, especially in Santa Barbara. Meat isn't necessary to survive and with the amount of vegan alternatives out there, not really a necessity at all. However, there is no equally efficient alternative to flying at the moment. There are other methods, like slow travel, which is better for the environment and pretty cool (if Greta Thunberg can do it, so can we). But these methods of transportation take much much longer than flying and aren't as readily available to the average person. With most of my immediate family living overseas, I don't know how I would even begin to find a boat and find the time to use that method of transportation to go see them, or for them to come see me. I would like to learn more about slow travel because I may just be uninformed about how good of an alternative it can be to flying, but currently it seems to be the most challenging of the 5 things Ken told us would hep save the Earth, while also being the most disastrous.

It was absolutely astounding to find out that 19 of 20 people in the whole world have never flown in a plane before. And although in hindsight it makes obvious sense why, I was equally surprised to hear that flying is the worst thing we actively contribute to the environment. I have always had a fascination and appreciation for airplanes and aerospace engineering, justifiably so as this industry and technology have allowed for the world to become ever more interconnected. But is this actually the case? While the technology and engineering are impressive and admirable, 80% of all flying is kept within only 1% of all people on Earth, leading me to question the premise if flying has been equally good for the rest of the world who have never stepped foot on an airplane before.

Much like the automobile/car culture that has captivated both the United States and the rest of the developed world, air travel has become a staple as the most common and recognized method of traveling at distance regionally, and internationally. In recent news, Qantas Airlines has been testing the world’s longest and direct flights from Sydney to New York and London. As many regard these non-stop flights as a “frontier” or “feat” in aviation, they also reap some of the worst consequences and impacts environmentally each time a jet touches down and lifts off from runways in different hemispheres. “Greenwashing” air travel has also been a common theme in the business and marketing strategies of almost every airline that dominates the runways. I think that these strategies are more harmful than helpful because they disregard the environmental truth about flying and give flyers an inaccurate understanding of the toll their travel takes on the environment. Ultimately, much like the car/automobile centered-culture that our society has adopted, I think finding effective environmental solutions to air travel will be equally, if not more hard to accomplish, as aviation continues to be the most efficient and desirable method of travel for long distances. Although many are aware of the toll flying has on the environment, people continue to book flights from Santa Barbara to San Francisco ( even LAX) simply because they have the finances and means to do so.

This was a lecture that I was nervous to watch as it hits close to home for me. I am an out of state student here at UCSB and every time I go home for a break it entails a lengthy flight across the country. My dad is a commuting businessman who has made his living off of traveling across the country and around the world. Flying is something that has always been very present in my lifestyle and it is deeply upsetting to learn about the extent of the damage I have already done. If I were to take a train from my home state to Los Angeles it would take 72 hours. This means I would have a necessary 6 days of travel taken out of any break. This may be possible for some, but personally, I feel as though I wouldn't even go home for a break less than a month if it took 6 days to do so. This is a harsh reality as I do not think I am willing to make this sacrifice so I'm sure many other people who are “jet-set” won't either. My dad’s job funds my whole family and flying is essential to this. This is why this issue is so hard for me to unpack because I know that if I keep living this way, I am doing great damage, but if I don't, my life would be deeply different. 

<br><br>

I thought the breaking down of the statistics of the effects of air travel was really important to this lecture. It really showed how deceiving numbers can be as 2 percent of carbon emissions would make one believe flying is fairly harmless. As Ken explained, this is so skewed based on the fact of how little of our world’s population is actually flying. This is something that I was fairly blind to through my privilege. It is a scary stat that just air travel alone can double or even triple my carbon footprint no matter how sustainably I may live. This is a figure that I can not ignore no matter how much I truly want to. Flying is something I have taken for granted as it makes my life easy, but I have to recognize my privilege and see how much damage is being done to this earth simply based on this ease I seek.  I realistically will fly again in my lifetime, but this video has definitely made me rethink this practice and make me want to strive to do better for my planet.

Similar to what you were saying about taking a train from your home state too Los Angeles, Ken had mentioned this electric bike idea from Santa Barbara to San Francisco(my home) in the video and I had a similar reaction. In order to get to San Francisco with an electric bike (which I think is crazy) would take three days of travel. Being a student, and or an employee somewhere there is just no way that we would be able to take 6 days of total travel time on top of the time we were already taking off for that vacation and or holiday. Learning about how planes are a signifiant enough contributor to the climate crisis was disappointing, mainly because I feel like that is something that won't change. It is pretty amazing that we have created a system that can get people to almost anywhere in the world within 24 hours. Eliminating personal vehicles and replacing them with better public transportation is a step in the right direction. Like your dad and thousands of other people, flying is an important tool that is necessary for their jobs, for their families, or even personal preference. There isn't a sufficient way to replace that method of transportation. Like you said, this video definitely makes us stop and rethink this kind of transportation, however I will still rely on it and use it which is kind of a bummer since I am knowingly making decisions that are hurting the planet and cannot avoid it.

It seems like flying did not take lots of percentage in air pollution before I watched the video. Well, I am true for parts of it. It surely takes little position in pollution, but the reason is due to the little population taking the plane. I do not except that much of co2 emitting into the air when I take the plane for once. So, I fairly support other transportations like telepresencing or slow travel. For my favor, telepresencing will be better solution since the slow travel is also realizing the co2 but less than the flight. I can understand that the central idea of slow travel, that is what we need for modern society. We are in the hurry to do everything but protecting the environment, we also hold the fast lifestyle which is much earlier for fast fashion to get through our daily life. The flight compared to the slow travel is more uncomfortable for me. You have to stay in relative little area, restricted action and stale air for breathing. I can predict that the change in tourism for slow travel is going to be extremely slow because the air travel industry still needs the profit for operation and less data to show the pollution that the flight could bring to environment.

It seems that this topic concerning air travel is one that hits close to home for many UCSB students. We have a significant population of out-of-state and international students. Considering that many students may live overseas and the fast-pace nature of our quarter system, taking a plane for some is really their only option. After reading the comments made by my peers, I recognize that many of us are conflicted: we are aware of the environmental consequences of our air travel but taking a ship overseas, or a train across the United States would simply take far too long. 
<br><br>


Personally, I live about an hour south of Santa Barbara and the relative proximity from my school to home allows me to transport myself by means of the county bus. It's quick, it's cheap ($4) and it’s an environmentally sustainable way to get around. However, some of my own hometown peers here at UCSB prefer to have a parent come for them or Uber home. The problem here, is that not enough of us take advantage of this transportation; not to mention that, the 50-seater bus rarely travels with any more than 10 passengers. For those of us that do live close to home, its is important that we do our part, because we can, and because it makes sense. Perhaps when choosing a school to attend, us students should also consider how much of our time, money and carbon footprint will go towards transporting ourselves back and forth.

as an international student, flying back and forth between my homeland and the States seems more than common for me, as this is what i have to do. It is shocking for me that my carbon footprint will be doubled or even tripled in these flyings. Flying back home is the easiest choice for me and I don't know what can replace it instead of the ultimate solution that flying less to home. In my homeland, i travel by high-speed train as much as possible, and I have to admit I just thought it might be cheaper than plane sometimes. I got to know taking the train is beneficial for environment after watching this video, I think I will re-evaluate my travelling plans now.

It is completely inevitable that international students as well as people with families overseas have to fly many times a year. I do not believe they should feel the need to see their families less just to eliminate their emissions. However, I do believe that domestic air travel can be significantly decreased without requiring people to make significant compromises. Busses and trains are a great alternative for traveling and often come with a cheaper price. While it may take longer to reach your desired destination, the benefits outweigh far outweigh spending that extra time. 
<br><br>

In order to achieve this, the United States needs to expand our train and bus sector. Increasing our infrastructure for busses and high-speed rails will make this type of traveling more appealing. Many other areas such as Europe and China have extensive high-speed rail lines that many people rely on rather than cars and planes. There is no reason the United States does not have this technology as well. As our population grows, the number of cars on the road is going to increase so much that traffic will make traveling a nuisance. This is yet another reason we need to add more trains.

This video is very saddening. It makes me apprehensively unhopeful for the future. I understand and accept sacrifices have to be made to all first world countries, such as moving to cities, downsizing, not driving, slowing down consumerism, etc. However, this flying issue seems improbably unfeasible, and does not look good for the climate crisis at all.  
<br><br>


One of my parents friend's family traveled to Louisiana to provide aide in Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, and I idealized them as hero's. I wanted to partake in a service trip in Africa, I guess I'll be doing more bad than good for humankind. Thinking about college students and limited time for breaks, how will out-of-staters get home to spend time with their loved ones without wasting all the days off traveling inefficiently. What about all those students wanting to immerse themselves in another culture and get a different perspective on life through studying abroad. Thinking about careers, many people's jobs require traveling and moving their bodies around. I guess profession sports (NBA, NFL, NHL, UFC, MLB, etc.) will have to disappear as a form of entertainment, considering their rigorous travel schedule, and high demand in other countries. Guess the Olympics, which have been going on since 776 BC, will have to end. The more we think, the sadder this gets. All college athletics will have to stop traveling for their away games. Will sports just vanish all together? Talk about sacrificing cultures to accommodate for the climate crisis. RIP to all the kids dreaming of being athletes at high levels. How can you tell people working hard with dreams to travel the world not to. Everyone loves vacations, so lets hope cruises are detrimental for one's carbon footprint? How can the rich and famous sacrifice the freedom of a private jet. What would happen to airline companies. What will happen to cities dependent on tourist based economies. How will the world stay connected, leaders attend peace summits, countries form alliances and sign trade treaties? Fast travel is crucial for today's society. At least this isn't a problem where America is the leading villain, right ? I understand that only the elite 1% travel by air, but some of these people need this efficient method of transportation to benefit the rest of the population.


<br><br>

If it isn't evident already, I feel panicked. I believe Professor Hiltner really needs to discuss backup options, instead of arguing for slow travel, which in this modern age will not appease the population. I would like more brainstorming of solutions to this plane problem. There has to be other options… What are the emissions rates for blimps, hot air balloons, helicopters, etc. Regarding vacations, what's the footprint of cruises. Or it seems like traveling by boat to different countries would be less harmful. "Hey Elon Musk, is there a way to change to electronic "smart" airplanes." Should we build sail boats the size of cargo ships ? Will building more railroads and train tracks help unify civilizations together? Something has to be better for visiting my sister in New York than an electric bike… Thanks for reading my rant, now lets discuss solutions and stay positive !

I am so glad that you were able to articulate many of my own concerns and frustrations regarding this topic. While I completely understand where Ken is coming from when he discusses the drawbacks of corporate travel and long-distance vacations, I think his listing of those impacted is inaccurate. Even if only one out of twenty people fly, there are exponentially more who enjoy/consume/experience various factors that are made possible by air travel. You did a great job identifying the major players and while some can be adjusted or subsituted, like business meetings and even international conferences, others cannot (at least with current tech) such as professional sports and the olympics. It’s terrifying to think that experiences that bring joy to so many, are such a source of national pride, and inspire so many people, come at the cost of the planet’s health.

<br><br>

In terms of solutions, I don’t have a ton of great ideas. With that being said, I think that we generally have to focus on reduction. For example, if professional sports leagues agreed to a slight reduction in the number of games played, increased time between contests, and tended to concentrate scheduling by regions, I think that that would be a start.


<br><hr>
I agree with what you said, especially the part about college students and short breaks. I think that while the slow transit movement makes a lot of sense, environmentally, it isn’t very practical in many instances. I, for one, live in Sacramento which is a 12-hour train/bus ride from Santa Barbara and many of my friends come from all around the country. They cannot reasonably take the train home for short breaks. If I were to train home for Thanksgiving break, I would spend half my break travelling and it would cost me $80. To fly home, it would cost me around $100, if I book it far enough in advance, and I would be home in less than an hour and a half. It just isn’t practical for me to train home for short breaks. And I don’t think I’m the only one in this situation. I don’t really know what the solution is except for the implementation of nationwide high-speed rail, which will likely not happen for a very long time if not never.
<br><hr>
Thank you for making sense and better articulating my rant. My previous comment was a heaping pile of grievances and limitations from lack of air travel. After slowing down and more calmly contemplating this lecture, it is more effective to focus on the impacts than brainstorming every event made possible by air travel. In regards to sports road trips, allowing more time between games for environmentally friendly travel and more proximal scheduling will reduce team's footprints while entertaining the passionate, patriotic public. As for the Olympics, imagine the symbolism and sending a message to the world if all the athletes representing the country prepared in advance and took the time to travel to Japan by boats and trains. Athletes are role models and public figures inspiring the world through their fans, so if these star players inspired the world in relation to reducing their carbon footprint, what a positive look that would be on such a big stage. The same way the "American Dream" connected being successful to consumerism, let's use sports as a platform for connecting national pride to reducing our carbon footprints. This is a game the whole population could play, in friendly competition with other countries to see who has the smallest footprint.

I understood the negative effect of air traveling and other possible ways of traveling. However, I think it still not that realistic for some people. Take international students as an example, it's impossible for them to go back to their country by other transportation besides airplane. The only way to solve this problem is inventing some faster transportation and it will also not emit that too much CO2. Besides this, the time for vacation is also a factor that many people chose the airplane. Because of the fast speed, many people can save more time on traveling by air. If someone only has 3 days for the vacation, and traveling by train will take him two days to go back and forth, what's the point of traveling? From my perspective, there is still some portion of people chose airplane because they don't have a better choice. I understand taking the airplane is a bad thing, but sometimes I have to. I hope in the future there will be another transportation that is faster and better for the environment than the airplanes.

I feel really sad when I heard that flying is the worst thing I can do environmentally. I love traveling, which means I fly a lot. I usually spend every single break traveling the different places with my girlfriend. And it makes me feel even worse when I hear the first/business class could double the emission. Since I’m tall and always have the chance to get free upgrade from the economy class to the business, thanks to my American Express credit card, there was no reason for me to give up this great advantage. I mean, normally, most people would take this advantage if they do not know the disadvantage of it. On the other hand, when I watched Ken’s video, I started to review my activities and consider if I did something wrong. As we are the new generation and are civilized and well-educated, it’s important for us to let more people know about the bad effects of flying. Admittedly, it is extremely hard for most people to find a alternative transportation right now; but, at least, we should not take the first/business class anymore. In the future, the new energy made for the airplane may reduce the effects of flying as well.

I think the worst part about watching this lecture video was that I had just purchased my flight to Florida for spring break. Whatever justifications I can use to dissipate my guilt, such as the fact that I’m visiting my mom or the fact that the time span of spring break wouldn’t allow us to see each other without use of a plane, don’t ultimately mean anything. Arguably, the planet doesn’t care. What I’m doing, despite my own reasons, has enormous repercussions. Thus, I’m faced with a decision; do I travel across the country by plane to see my mom now, or do I wait another few months until I have more time to travel slowly, by train or bus?
<br><br>

Choosing the latter is not something we are used to, having become accustomed to immediate and convenient goods and services. However, as with slow food and clothing as opposed to fast, travel is another thing to consider doing differently. Will we be able to write air travel out completely? I believe this is a similar question that was presented with cars and my response remains consistent; for planes to be completely cut out of our culture, we need drastic infrastructural and cultural change. There would need to be a replacement of sorts that could provide near equivalent results of travel in a greener more efficient way as well as a shift in values and process of thought. I am optimistic that something this immeasurable can occur if we start now, though likely not in my lifetime nor the lifetime of the generation that follows mine.
<br><br>

What was troubling to me was that flying could double or triple your personal climate footprint, thus “…nullifying all the gains of otherwise environmentally conscientious lifestyle.” Despite my best effort – becoming vegetarian and food shopping locally and seasonally, borrowing and buying secondhand only when necessary, biking and using public transportation, etc. – it seems all for not since I fly. It is very easy to feel despondent about this, though I see it as an opportunity to do things differently; I’ve never slow traveled before though it sounds incredibly enjoyable, and train travel up the coast of California is now on my bucket list. A lessened standard of living is entirely subjective. I think it simply begins with a change in mindset.

The lecture video concerning flying was rather a disappointing fact for me. I enjoy traveling and want to travel in the future to countries that are far away. However, it is true that flying simply emits too much CO2 into our environment which leads to a personal conflict. While there are suitable alternatives to travel such as the train, it gets more complicated and lengthy to travel to other continents. I don’t believe that people would be willing to give up being able to quickly travel a great distance. It is unfair that the rich are the ones using private jets but will be the ones to suffer the least from climate change effects. This resounds more when 99% of people have not used an airplane as a means of travel. In other words, 99% of people will suffer for the luxury of the 1% of the other people. Personally, I can plan fewer trips and trips where once I land overseas, I use other forms of transport to travel around the area. Like mentioned in the video, this can be an experience within itself where I can see the landscapes of foreign areas.

I found Ken’s take on air travel to be interesting because it seems a bit out of touch with what I consider to be “realistic” travel options. I do not see myself planning days ahead in order to take a train or several buses to an airport across the country in order to reduce the amount of air miles I accumulate on a vacation somewhere. It just doesn’t seem practical if I’m being honest. I guess that would make me part of the problem, but who is actually putting this type of  “sustainable travel” mentality into practice? It’s hard to take accountability for the negative impacts of flying places when it’s the only practical way to get to and from locations far away from one another; especially with work/school time constraints. This lecture makes me question where we draw the line between innovation and sustainability. Are we simply supposed to revert back to outdated forms of travel or reduce technology overall in order to be able to keep our planet alive? Because such a task seems nearly impossible. If you were to put the idea of eliminating all air travel on a global scale it would cause riots. But at what point is something so radical supposed to be done; do we do it once the planet is already dead? Doing so would be far too late at that point. Hearing lectures like this really challenges what we need to prioritize as a society in order to ensure that people live their lives enjoyably, while also preserving the planet we live on.

The fact that a single flight from the US to Europe generates more carbon than a single person should use in an entire year in order to comply with the Paris agreement is amazing. So many people criticize the Trump administration for refusing to participate in the Paris agreement (and they should), but individuals who fly multiple times a year are also playing a part in disregarding the national accord. I think the biggest obstacle we face in trying to reduce emissions from flying is that people tend to think it is there only option, domestically and especially overseas. While I don't fly that much, if I were to go to New York or Europe I definitely would consider flying to be the only option. I think Ken's proposition at the end of the lecture regarding slow travel was interesting, and something I haven't heard much discussion about. This is because we never really think about lifestyle changes, rather we always think about quick alternatives. When you compare a flight to a train, you can't just compare efficiency and time, or else the flight will seem like the far superior option. We need to rethink our goals and ambitions while traveling. Right now, as Ken stated, it is extremely destination-based. Destination-based thinking will always lead us to the option that gets us there the fastest. Slow-travel requires an entirely different outlook on the meaning of travel. 
<br><br>

Getting people to change not just their actions/the products they use but the way they think is probably the biggest challenge we will face in combating the climate crisis. At the same time, it will give us the most drastic results. Arbitrary exchanges in our consumer culture may make small impacts on climate change, but until we can alter our set of priorities and broad lifestyle choices, I don't think we will be able to make significant progress.

As someone who is guilty of traveling via airplane often throughout my life, I felt ashamed watching this video. It has been well known that flying is very detrimental to the environment. There is no denying the convenience of airplanes in comparison to any other form of travel, however we must decide what is more important to us, convenience or our impact on the Earth. 
<br><br>
One way to travel other than planes, is by train as Ken stated. Since being in college, I have taken the train a few times to various places. Prior to taking the train I had a view that it would be dirty and an overall poor way of traveling. However I was quite pleased with my experience on the train. The train is surprisingly spacious, more so than airplanes, and you can get up and walk around or go to buy food, something you can't do while driving. 
<br><br>
I believe public transit gets a bad reputation when in actuality it isn't so bad. While our current system is already nice, in my opinion, it could be much better and more efficient if we put the money we spend on planes into public transit. Planes are not apart of a sustainable society, they are too detrimental. Turning to public transit systems would send the message to our government what's important to us and what we want our money invested in.

I completely understand and I am very proud of the fact that you have changed your air travel to train. I like to think of this method of very effective but when I think of traveling to Paris from Santa Barbara then I think about how the time to travel there would be so inconvenient the ride there and back would be the essentially the whole vacation. I definitely agree with the convenience of flying and even giving up flying makes me realize how inconvenient most traveling times would be. But then I do agree that the thought of riding a train seems pretty interesting to, and I definitely would not be opposed to using the train to go back home. In regards to public transportation, it has such a negative connotation to it but traveling via train and or even via bus is a lot better than people typically assumed. We could definitely make traveling via public transit so much easier and more effective for the environment. The government should definitely encourage more usage of public transportation because of the mass improvements possible for the environment as a whole.

Ken pointed out that it will emit three tons of CO2 if a person takes a round trip from LA to Paris. Furthermore, people who choose to fly first class will produce twice that amount of CO2. However, by taking personal approach, CO2 emissions can be reduced quite a lot. Ken divides flying into three parts, flying for business, for recreation, and for both. If people intend to take recreational travel, they can consolidate two travel into one. Instead of taking two short trips every year, people can take a longer trip every two years. Moreover, people can take other transportation which will release much less CO2. For instance, people can take a train from LA to NY and take an airplane to Paris if they manage to go to Paris from LA. Also, people who have to travel for business can have meetings online. Since telepresencing is well known, and people can utilize this technology to avoid flying which will produce lots of CO2. Ken also maintained that the travel is not all about the destination, and he compared slow travel to slow food. 
   <br><br>
  In my perspective, it really inspires me. I was believing that travel is not all about the destination, but when flying is available, I was told by my friends that you should save your time, and the airplane is fast and comfortable transportation which can take you to the destination rapidly, and it is a way to show off. Then, I began to travel by taking an airplane. This lecture made me understand that both travel and life are not all about the destination. Furthermore, I am aware that the transportation I chose will have a huge impact on the Earth.

Let's be honest about how much I hate flying and love slow travels from a long time ago, it's just not practical for people to give up flying since there are so so many cases which flying is just necessary. Of course one can take a slow pace and enjoy a vacation when they have the free time to so, but not everyone travels just for entertainments. 

   <br><br>


As depressing as it seems, although I agree that people should minimized their unnecessary flights, flying culture itself is impossible to be challenged. Different from the concepts from Minimalism and our consumers' culture, flying has long became a way of living and it has been engraved in the core of our society. Furthermore, I don't even think it's a good trade off for giving up such an efficient tool of traveling(again I agree we should minimize unnecessary flights and replace them with slow travels and internet features or calls). 


   <br><br>

Instead of taking Ken's perspective that "our efforts on protecting environment are nullified", I would rather accept that we are doing our best to undo our inevitable harms to our environments by doing many other things to lower our carbon footprint. In conclusion, flying in many situations can't be replaced, you won't be able to find many alternates such as "A Bus exchange for Cars". People who just gotta fly won't have any other options and won't be convinced. A better focus or direction to change this is to do research on newer planes that are more environment friendly, or cleaner fuels that can be used in a plane.

It is so crazy to think of the amount of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, that are emitted by air travel. As mentioned, a flight from Los Angeles to Paris emits 2 tonnes of carbon, which is the max amount we are supposed to emit per year! I have never flown in a plane before, so it makes me feel a little bit better of my traveling choices. The car is not much better of course, but it is surely a lot less than a plane. The farthest I traveled by car was to San Francisco, which took around 8 hours. It was kind of like a "slow travel" in a way, with lots of stops to enjoy the views and check little towns out here and there. This allowed for more bonding with my friends and the trip over there and the car ride definitely became one of our favorite parts of the trip. I feel like this experience made me much more open to the concept of slow travel Ken mentioned in the lecture. I think an electric bike all the way up to the coast would be a little extreme, but I am all for an improved mass transit system, with buses and trains taking us up from Los Angeles to San Francisco in a much faster way. More dedicated bike paths and infrastructure is definitely needed though. UCSB has a nice system of bike paths; if that were implemented in many cities, I feel many more would be inclined to ride bikes and to lower their carbon footprint per year. 
   <br><br>

Also, another point on the plane rides adding a carbon footprint is the amount of times professional sport teams fly. In the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL, teams have to make so many flights for road games and to go back home, often daily flights. I do not think it will be possible to negate this, as teams have to play series back to back and games, and flying is the fastest way to travel from coast to coast. This may lead to longer seasons if there is more "slow travel", such as teams taking the bus. It would take days for teams to get across the country to play games. It will be interesting to see how any mandate on the amount of flying will affect professional sport leagues. But I do agree, there definitely needs to be a lot less flying, by business and sport teams alike.

The fact that 95% of the people on the planet have never set a foot on an airplane means that we should honestly check our privilege. When I first heard Ken say that 2% of the total greenhouse gas emissions is due to air travel, I honestly dismissed it being such a huge issue. I thought why we would care about such a small percentage when things like passenger cars and power plants release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But when he broken down the statistics to an individual perspective, it became clearer on how air travel is largely destructive. Many people are not willing to cut out air travel completely from their lives, and honestly that’s understandable. The issue with time and convenience is the reason air travel is popular to travel large distances domestically and internationally. I think a good idea to reduce the amount of flights is to ban domestic flights in some countries. This is only a good idea in countries like Japan and Germany where they have the infrastructure of a high-speed train that connects most major cities. The U.S. has a lot to learn from other countries when it comes to high-speed rail systems. Within the last decade China has more than 19,000 miles of high-speed rail built.

I found some of the statistics mentioned in this lecture to be quite shocking. Flying is certainly a luxury, as mentioned in the video. I was, however, unaware that there was such a small amount of people in this world that used planes. I found it shocking that 19/20 people in the world have never stepped in a plane. This really goes to show how it is the wealthiest people in the world that are contributing the most to the climate crisis, and the poorest are dealing with most of the consequences of it. I also found the fact that only 1% of frequent fliers constitute 80% of all flights. That is such an extreme number of flights for such a small amount of people. The fact that flying creates so much CO2 to be put into the atmosphere is something that is very concerning and needs to be addressed and fixed as soon as possible. 
    <br><br>
The solutions Ken mentioned in his video are very reasonable. The basic underlying message was to fly less, and I think that is completely doable. I am someone who really enjoys traveling, however, if it is going to hurt the environment, I think it is very doable to cut down on flying to different places and prioritizing travel by land. For instance, when traveling within the country, we could use trains that Ken mentioned. I find this to be very reasonable. It may take longer, but you are getting to your destination quite comfortably, and it is so much better for the environment. Flying is not something we have to completely stop, but it is something that we should learn to cut back for the better of our planet.

So far, I have been 100% on board with what Ken has been telling us about the climate and how we can help it. However, I think it is very unrealistic to say I will never fly again. While I agree that people who take private jets often and unnecessarily are a huge part of the problem , I don't think telling the average human that they shouldn't fly will ever be accepted by the majority of the public-including myself. For example, being the Power of Attorney for my sick dad who lives in another state...I have to hop on a plane any time there is a medical emergency or when he is signing legal documents, ,etc., I cannot drive there and I definitely can't take a cross-country bike trip there. This is just one example of why flying is kind of hard to avoid. Again, I agree luxury flying is totally avoidable but for situations that need a quick reaction, flying kind of saves the day...Also, it is hard to get into the mindset that I shouldn't fly because part of me says "the plane is going to take off regardless and if I don't use the ticket, someone else just will." I know this mindset is probably not beneficial, but it’s just honestly how I feel about planes and flying. If Ken is reading this, I'd like to ask a question: What is more damaging to the environment, in terms of CO2 usage...if I drove to NY in my car, or if I flew there?

I feel as if flying is one of those things that are somewhat unavoidable and out of my control. Being that some people benefit so much out of flying, it’s hard to think of this mode of transportation as something that can be erased from our culture. I rarely fly, and only do it if it is the last option. I think most people can agree that flying is sometimes a necessity, as some need to travel across the globe in a certain time gap due to unruly circumstances. Sometimes flying is the most reasonable action. I do understand that people that fly first class and have their own private jets disrupt the system more, and what I understand from it is that these people should be educated on how much CO2 emissions they’re creating. But aside from them, there’s a bunch of people that fill the economy seats on planes and I see this as a parallel to the motion of taking people out of their cars and switching to putting them on a city bus. I also wonder how much of a difference it would make if everyone that were boarding a plane decided to travel across the country in their own car instead. Maybe flying isn’t the problem, but the way the airline companies run their industry is.

Cutting back flying does not really affect me very much currently since I never travel distances far enough to justify buying a plane ticket. I have been on a plane before, but not for the past ten years. The effect of air travel on the environment is disappointing though, since I wanted to travel to other countries after I graduated. Traveling has always been something that I wanted to do, but knowing how bad it is (and how expensive it can get) stops me from making any plans on long distance travel. If I do plan on traveling by plane still, I would take the advice that Ken gave about crossing land by train and oceans by plane, cutting my air travel time. I also would not plan to fly every year, spacing out flights between many years. 
    <br><br>
Slow travel should be more popular since it does give a lot more time to enjoy the trip rather than stressing over getting to an airport and through the gate. When I can, I take the Amtrak home from Santa Barbara. It's about a six hour ride, but the experience is wonderful. The train is right along the coast most of the time, giving you a perfect view that will never cease to amaze me. A train ticket is also much cheaper than a plane or if I were to drive. There are times where I dread sitting in the same seat for six hours, so a faster train would be great, but I will take what I can get. It just makes weekend trips home, such as for Thanksgiving and Easter, very difficult when I always have Friday and Monday classes, which leaves me very little time to spend with my family. But at least I feel at ease by doing my part for the environment.

I agree with Professor Ken that although people try to put some effort on solving those environmental problems such as eating less meat, living in remote area, taking public transportation, when they plan to take a flight, things would become worse. One trip would cause tons of carbon dioxide which is two or three times more than cars or trains. I think with the development of modern technology, people could stay more at home and contact with their friends by phone and internet instead of hanging out and taking a long flight to other city. This could definitely emit less carbon dioxide than hanging out. What’s more, we could change our plan such as we could have a trip once a year instead of twice. This could definitely decrease the pollution that we make. And  we could also stay at home playing our phone, watching tv, and reading books. Not only hanging out but also staying at home could both expand our horizon.

As a frequent flyer myself, I feel ashamed of the carbon footprint I carry. Before this class, I never really took a minute to think about the implications that come with flying. The thing I worried about most when I flew in the past was the monetary value that I would be losing when I flew, but now after taking this class, I take more into account the carbon footprint that I will gain by flying home instead of driving. For some people though, flying can pretty much be the only option. For example, if I had lived on the other side of the world, the only way I could possibly get there would be to fly because taking any other mode of transportation would be not only inconvenient, but inefficient. I was very surprised at the amount of people who have never ridden in an airplane before, but I believe that surprise mainly comes from living a very comfortable life for the last 19 years. To have that big of a carbon footprint with so little of the actual world’s population using airplanes is scary. People living in first world countries are so oblivious to the carbon footprint they hold with the exception of a few people and it scares me to think only the actions of a portion of the population are endangering entire species and races. I hope within the next decade we can come together as a dominant society in terms of becoming more environmentally friendly in the most efficient way possible.

I always knew that flying was bad for the environment, but it wasn't until I watched this video that I realized the scale of how bad it was compared to driving. It is insane how taking a round trip flight from LA to Paris would cause 3 tons of CO2 to be emitted into the upper atmosphere (and that flying first class would cause twice as much damage). I think it is also alarming how the amount of people flying is going up in places like China. I also did not realize until watching this video how flying was limited only to the top 5% of Americans. My family is fairly well off and it was very common for us to take a flight every couple of years to a vacation spot. I did not realize how much of a luxury that was, and what a devastating effect those trips have on the environment. I think that in the future I will talk to my family about taking fewer trips, or if we do take trips to go to places within driving distance, and perhaps take a train there instead of driving the family car. This video yet again makes me wish that the public transportation system in the United States was improved, because I know my family would be averse to taking a trip by train rather than by car due to the inconveniences that come with traveling by train (for example being able to bring along less stuff). Hopefully, by informing my family of the negative effects of both air and car travel, I can convince them to make a change in their lifestyle such as transitioning to slow travel.

I never really never looked into the amount of environmental impact air traffic had. I knew it was not necessarily good for the environment, but I did not realize how much it increased one's carbon footprint. I consider myself an environmentalist, but also a big traveler. My dream in life is to see the world and explore all over. I would not call myself a frequent flyer, but I tend to fly one to three times a year, and I did not realize how much that was hurting the environment. This past winter I flew to London to visit my sister, while she was studying abroad, and personally I would never have traded this opportunity for the world. When going there flying was my only option, she only had one week left there and I left friday of finals week and came home on December 21st, with my sister. I understood Ken’s point talking about taking a train across the country then flying to your destination, but in this case it would not have been practical for me. Taking a train across the country would cut my time with my sister, abroad, basically in half, making the trip not worth it. It is however practical for one to cut down the amount of times they fly, and make it less frequent, but it is very unpractical for one to expect someone to completely stop flying and switch to slower modes of transportation, like trains and bikes. Another example is my roommate lives in Boston, practically she could take a train across the country, but considering she only gets to see her family two times a year flying gets here much quicker, therefore extending her time with everyone back home, who she rarely gets to see. This is the same for my step sister, who goes to school at Northwestern in Chicago. She only gets to come home twice a year and wants to maximize her time at home, so taking a train does not maximize her time. Asking people to not fly or just take the slower modes of transportation does not seem practical to me, and is almost asking too much. Many people rely on the fast travel of airplanes due to many reasons. I know I sound contradicting for saying this and claiming I am an environmentalist, but cutting off flying is something I see as not the fix. I do however support educating people on the effects of flying, and encourage them to fly less. Personally I am now way more aware of the carbon footprint flying, and will do my best to limit how much I fly, but I cannot commit to not flying, because I do want to see the world and have amazing experiences all around it.

I feel the same way. Traveling the world is on my bucket list! I want to see other countries, experience other cultures, and see all of the historical ancient architecture that we lack here in the USA. For me, just looking at pictures/being there via the Internet just isn't enough for me. During this video, I began to feel like I was selfish for wanting to travel, but I feel like I should be able to want to go to other places, and not be stuck where I was born. I do understand the push to take trains or travel on the ground as much as you can before resorting to air travel, but I also understand the urgency of some trips. My dad is only home for 1/4 of the year, and the rest of the year he is across the country for his job. He flies home for important events, like my high school graduation, and then immediately has to fly out again. I know that environmentally this isn't great, but I wouldn't have traded my dad being there for anything else. Slow travel wasn't an option for him, because he could only take a little time off of work to come home. 
    <br><br>


I know that Ken is implying that if you have the time, try and look into slow travel for vacations, or try not to vacation at all,  and I do believe if you have the time, to yes, try to reduce your environmental impact. But I do believe air travel does not have an environmentally friendly alternative that provides us with the same result. And while I hope that one day it will, I can definitely see how people are hesitant to cut off flying as a feasible means of transportation.
    <br><br>


But what about travel by sea? I don't really see much about it anymore, with the exception of cruises. I'm not really big on cruises, I feel like they're expensive, and I know that they're not about getting somewhere in a timely fashion. But what if they were? I can't help but wonder if that's an answer? Or maybe it would make things worse. I don't know the solution to all of this, but I really hope someone does.

I’m really surprised to hear that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot in an airplane. I thought many more have, but it is understandable how traveling by air is very exclusive to those who can afford it. I could count how many times I have been on a plane with my fingers, yet each flight was still detrimental. A round-trip flight from LA to Paris would emit three tons of carbon dioxide. Under the Paris accord that says every individual should emit no more than two metric tons of CO2 per year, I would have used a year and a half worth of my entire CO2 allocation. It’s double flying first class and tremendously greater by jet!
    <br><br>

I think this is why Greta Thunberg has gained international recognition as an environmental activist. She has brought a lot of attention towards the climate crisis and also has implemented dramatic changes in her lifestyle. Even on an international level, she utilizes boats to minimize her CO2 footprint. This is incredibly selfless because a big reason why people fly is to save time. People do not enjoy slow travel, but as Ken discussed, it helps significantly. I live in northern California and I use rideshare (carpool with students) over flying because of the cost difference. If flying was cheaper, perhaps I would have flown a few times by now. This was a great reminder that though flights may be appealing because of their cut on time, they are extremely harmful to the world. I too would think that taking a lot of time commuting just wastes time, but now I can acknowledge the journey can be looked at fondly. You can even gain a sense of pride from putting in effort. This refers to Ken’s examples of cooking a meal versus purchasing, knitting your clothes versus buying, and radically speaking, biking from LA to SF instead of flying. Even looking back at road trips, I have the memories at the location, but traveling back and forth as well, remembering being crammed with my siblings and watching movies on our little screen and our random discussions and etc. By taking care of our planet, we may end up doing things that help us appreciate life more.

In the same light, It’s hard for me to comprehend how one plane flying to a place like Boston is worse than 40 cars or so making the same trek. And the amount of people who will never set foot on an airplane is insane considering how detrimental air travel is to our atmosphere. Again, we see a direct connection between environmental destruction and social class. Ironic, isn’t it, how the people with the most resources and opportunities are the ones who are abusing our planet the worse.

Going off of your statement, I completely agree that young activists like Greta Thunberg are creating waves of climate awareness on an international level. Her efforts are boundless, her choosing to sail across the Atlantic Ocean rather than fly was just as impactful as one of her speeches would be. Recognizing that your day to day life creates so much pollution and harm is only the first step in adjusting to a dying world. The next is to change your lifestyle. But when it comes to common things such as shopping for fast fashion or visiting a far away place via plane, people tend to shy away from the fact that climate change prevention occurs on an individual level. It is our conscious choice to shop local or choose the public transportation option that will combat anthropogenic emissions. Persuading society to choose the environmentally safe route over the more convenient route, I’m afraid, is an impossibly huge challenge that we must overcome.

I was also surprised to hear that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never set foot on a plane, before this lecture, I thought that more people have flown before. But now I realize that flying is a privilege that not many can afford. I myself have only flown a handful of times and it was either to visit family in China or for vacation. It’s crazy how flying once takes up a year and a half of the carbon that should be emitted for one person. I also find it respectable that such a young activist like Greta Thunberg herself has brought up the negative impacts. I find it extremely selfless, that she herself, does her best to lessen her carbon footprint by utilizing boats for overseas travel. I live in Los Angeles and I always take a rideshare home to lessen my carbon footprint. It is definitely more efficient than if everyone were to drive home by themselves. This lecture made me realize that although flying is convenient and quick, there are so many other traveling alternatives that are more environmentally friendly than taking an airplane. Although “slow travel” is definitely a lot slower than say flying, it can make us appreciate a slower- paced life.

I found it really astonishing just how environmentally awful flying is. I knew that it was obviously bad for the environment since it is like a much bigger automobile, but I had no idea the extent of damage. I’ve flown from LA to Paris before and the idea that it released 3 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere is a hard fact to wrap my head around. Airplanes are seen as one of the best inventions of modern times since it has completely changed travel and globalization as we know it and now take for granted. Due to that, we have ignored the environmental consequences that come attached to our luxurious travel. I found it really interesting that only 1/20 people have been in an airplane. That is my privilege coming to play as the people I am surrounded by have had the luxury of flying for travel sometimes. Again, convenience comes into play. Time is money to most people and people will pay for convenience the same way they will pay for a car over public transportation or biking. I think the solution is that convenience simply has to start becoming pricier to make people change their ways. I find this a very hard dilemma as I personally want to travel the world and flying is the easiest way to do that, and I took it for granted without realizing the full envrionmental cost. It is tough to find a solution because while I say to make it more expensive and have people pay for the convenience and environmental costs, I still want to be able to reap the benefits of travel and not price myself out. While I agree that slow travel is probably a much more rewarding experience and I would love to try it, it just isn’t as practical. We definitely need to be able to find more alternatives like expanding trains and other modes of transportation in order to have a relatively close substitute to flying. This video was eye-opening and is an issue that needs to be addressed promptly.

As someone who only has flown a handful of times, I had not given much thought to the environmental impacts that it can have. My dad is a firm believer that “time is money” and prefers to do things in the quickest way possible, and that includes traveling. We typically fly when we take family vacations, as we don’t want to waste a day and a half or so on each end of the trip being cooped up in the car together. But after watching this video, I am motivated to encourage my father to consider taking other means of transportation. Over Thanksgiving break, I took the train home because flights were too expensive. At first, I wasn’t thrilled at the idea of an eight hour travel experience that would take around three if I flew. But I honestly enjoyed it. I was able to catch up on homework, read my book, and nap much easier than if I was on a plane. People often avoid taking trains or buses because they feel it takes longer, but when you take into consideration all the time spent waiting in security lines and at boarding gates, the difference can be minimal (depending on where you are going). And plus, it is a cheaper way to travel. Obviously we cannot take a train or bus every time we hope to travel (especially if we are overseas), but it is a good idea to do it whenever you can. I plan on taking a trip to Europe this summer, and besides the initial flight over I will be taking trains or buses to move from country to country. Not only is it a great way to get some extra sight-seeing in, it puts much less strain on the environment. I think the general stigma around public transportation needs to change. Our society is very accustomed to instant gratification, and intentionally traveling in a way that will slow them down is not very appealing. Educating people on the environmental impacts of air travel and promoting the many positive aspects of public transportation by people in power are a crucial step towards mitigating the climate crisis.

As someone who absolutely hates air travel I can honestly say this is one of the few things Ken will ask of us to do that I can 100% say "no problem" to. However I think it's important to consider what our options are. Yes people need to travel by plane less and more efficiently. But eventually people need to stop flying. We see this and we know this now. But we can't cut global travel. landmasses connected by land can use train or bus, but countries like Australia, or for travel between continents, cutting off contact with other countries would be terrible. Would we revert back to a pre-air travel world, where people are confined to their own countries. I mean this in the sense that the world should continue to try to unite by exploring each other countries. We can obviously take boats which are a little friendlier, but I believe it would be a little easier to make boats environmentally friendly rather than planes.  I'm not saying I know how to fix anything, but it's interesting to consider how airplanes may become absolete and what might replace it. If we get some kind of teleport machine that would be so dope. If not, will the age of steamers and boat travel come back? That would be so cool! 
    <br><br>
I think another big point that Ken hits is about climate injustice (again). The privilege of being able to leave your country and fly to another one purely for leisure is something that, as Ken points out, the majority of the world has never even gone in a plane. Yes they we are going to be affected by the climate crisis they didn't create, but additionally the fact that people are unwilling to give up this recreational activity to help others would be incredibly selfish. 
    <br><br>
I love what Ken said about slow travel. I can think of literally nothing better than slowly making my way up the coast of California, by walking biking or taking a train. The idea of slowing life down and forcing us to be more mindful and present in our life has a hippie aesthetic I am so down for. I agree with Ken, the journey is the important.

I find it shocking how much a small group of people on the planet contributes to the ongoing deterioration of our atmospheric conditions. The amount of resources exhausted for this form of transportation is absolutely unsustainable, especially with the international efforts being instilled to mitigate the climate crisis. I understand that there are professions and other circumstances that are not as flexible in transportation. It is a fortune to have other modes of transportation that have a significantly less impact. I like how Ken considered different ways to get to different places, considering many passengers on planes are there for business or vacations. I also like how he also said that one can still enjoy their vacations, but be more environmentally friendly in the process. In addition, by relating the experience of traveling to the profound phrase “Life is about the journey, not the destination”, I feel like I have a more grounded, new perspective on the ways we as humans can contribute to combating climate  =change. I have some relatives that reside in the Philippines. Our family ideally wishes to visit them every other year, but from what I learned from this video, I can only imagine our contributions to the widespread greenhouse effect if this became a routine activity. As of currently, my parents video chat them on a nearly daily basis; I feel sound knowing that we can still keep our family ties strong in a way less invasive manner.

I enjoy the convenience brought by advanced technology and never pay attention to the cost of development before taking this class. In this video, I surprisingly found that flying is such a worse thing to environment. The fast speed of flying saves our time but it cuts down the lifespan of the Earth. Fortunately, the newly rise movement called slow travel is gradually accepts by the public. More and more people choose the low-carbon transportation such as buses and trains. Realizing the damage results of flying, I decide to not choose flying unless it is the only option. I'd rather take trains or ships though they are time-consuming compared with flying. But think in a different perspective, the meaning of travelling is to enjoy a new view and embrace a happier life. The destination is less important because arriving the destination is not our propose. Slow travel movement allows people to discover the beauty of nature, in which flying cannot provide. Besides, while appreciate the relaxing view, we protect our planet at the same time. This is really a two-pronged move that everyone should join in.

I agree I also enjoy the convenience of advanced technology but it should not be at the cost of the Earth’s lifespan. I have never travelled by airplane mostly because my family lives under one roof. I recently started traveling by train when I came to UCSB and before then my form of transportation was bus or walking. While I like being an efficient person it is also nice to walk and talk to someone. Like Ken said in his video traveling by other forms like train can bring joy as you get to connect with people and view a lot of amazing scenery. My favorite part of traveling is when friends come with me and we spent the time talking or watching movies. When I travel alone I like to look outside at the ocean or the greenery around me. Just this weekend I went to Oxnard and was able to see the calming waves, greenery, and cute houses. While getting somewhere quickly is the more likable option there can be a lot to enjoy from a longer commute.

Flying: a remarkably environmentally-detrimental mode of transportation that was once viewed as exclusive, accessible only to the wealthiest and most privileged of the population. Air travel has now transformed into what many would refer to as a convention, with hundreds of thousands of people nationwide turning to flight as their preferred method of transit.

    <br><br>

With the Santa Barbara Airport so close to campus, I can’t help but visualize the roaring airplanes passing overhead as three tons of greenhouse gas emissions each. Rather than shaming the individuals seated in them- some may be traveling by air just to get home to see their loved ones, or maybe even for family emergencies- I would like to take a step back and reflect on my personal ventures via air travel. I have only ever boarded an aircraft once in my 18 years of life. This flight was to Taiwan, where I had the opportunity to visit relatives and explore my culture. Still, I can’t help but feel guilty after learning the statistics of air travel mentioned in this lecture video.
    <br><br>


I would like to encourage my peers and any audience members alike to turn to carpooling, taking the AmTrak, or even giving the method that Ken mentioned in the video (e-biking, taking the train, or driving, crashing at various AirBnB’s, and stopping by landmarks on the way to your destination) a try. Although it may be challenging to make such a switch because of the comfort and ease that flying grants us, it would be massively helpful to prevent any further damage to the environment.

Flying, unsurprisingly, is the most environmentally destructive form of transportation. In order to make travel that convenient, some form of negative payoff has to come from it. Although it only accounts for a mere 2% or so of the annual greenhouse gas emissions globally, each trip has a huge effect on the deposit of CO2 and mononitrogen oxides into our atmosphere (with the oxides being 2-3x more damaging in regard to short term climate effects). I could see how this effect is even more amplified with frequent flyers and long destination flights, where more fuel is needed in order to accommodate increased travel.

    <br><br>

As you mentioned in the last part of your response, public transportation and rideshares are so much more environmentally sustainable, as well as economically sustainable as well. Although it takes longer, it is much more worth it in many ways.

I knew flying would impact the environment, however I did not know how big the impact was. I also did not know that flying first class is double the amount of carbon dioxide emission than regular, although it does make sense now that I think of it. Watching this lecture made me realize how privileged I am,  considering 80% of flights are made by just 1% of the world, and I travel to Vietnam by air travel almost annually. The flight to Vietnam from San Jose Airport is around 16 hours, I can not imagine how much carbon dioxide I emit from my yearly Vietnam vacation trips. I agree with Ken that we should use public transportation more than air travel, and reduce our air travel. Even though it would be less convenient, therefore less appealing, it would be less environmentally disastrous, therefore better for our environment. Going back to the first reading, if we do not do anything about climate change, the consequences will be disastrous for us and future generations. Even though it would be less convenient for us, it would be good for the environment, which is the bigger picture that we have to start worrying about now.

It is mindboggling how I am more informed and aware of the climate crisis than the general population,
    <br><br>
yet I have never questioned the use of private jets and the ridiculous damage it is doing to our atmosphere. I scroll past celebrities and other social media influencers who post about taking private jets every day, all over the world! A stunning statistic Ken emphasized was that taking a plane from LAX to Paris already expends your carbon footprint for a year-make it three if you take first class. Imagine how many years ahead of her carbon footprint someone like Kylie Jenner is, coupled with her sprawling properties, luxurious cars, clothing, etc. The damage one does by overindulging in a high-class lifestyle drills in the point that we all collectively have to make strides to decrease our environmental impact. Simply because you have the affluence to live such a life doesn’t mean that you should. I am fearful that as our society travels even further towards mass air travel- China’s 50% increase as example- it is going to become societally common and acceptable. In reality, although only 5% of the population utilizes air travel, we need to limit even that number. 
    <br><br>

I agree with Ken’s proposition to take advantage of alternative traveling methods, such as trains, buses, and bikes. Similar to his fond memory of traveling cross-country on train, I reminiscence on my freshman year train journeys back home during holiday breaks. I value these experiences much more than my stuffy plane rides to San Francisco or Arizona. Reflecting on my own pleasant experiences, I am considering incorporating slow travel into my life; not only is it environmentally friendly, but it is
    <br><br>
packaged with memorable life experiences.

I personally travel by train to go from Santa Barbara to visit San Diego consistently and knowing that it does not largely contribute to emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as air travel does is relieving. The advantage from air travel is arriving sooner to a certain destination compared to slow travel, which can become very annoying. Yet many use air travel despite its larger implications on the planet. Because those who use air travel more frequently, I believe it is completely possible to at least greatly reduce the use of it. If more awareness was spread to this population to reduce their air travel and at least split their trip by traveling halfway through saw travel as Ken mentioned, it would already begin to make an impact. Setting a carbon tax on airplane tickets could also help reduce the amount of people traveling, especially on shorter destinations and resorting to slow travel. Just as during the cigarette scandal, spreading more awareness about negative implications could reduce the use of these actions. The air travel industry would be the ones to suffer but in all things comes adaptation to a changing world and they could adapt to a changing climate.

I travel once a year to visit my family in India. The plane ride there is probably the best part of the trip. My brother and I stay up during the entire 19 hour flight and watch movies, make jokes, and enjoy the excitement of seeing our entire family for two whole months. The ride back is always filled with sadness because we know we're going to have to wait a whole year to see my grandparents and aunts and uncles again. With slow trips, the idea is sound in theory, but flying has created a situation where people are used to being across the country in hours. If it took me even 2 weeks to get to India by boat, I don't think I'd ever be able to go visit my family at all. Having one grand vacation every five years would mean that I can't watch my baby cousins grow up, and might even miss crucial time with my grandparents. I know that the planet is at stake, but frankly I wish there was an easier way to lower the amount of carbon emissions from planes because I'm not ready to stop traveling altogether. I appreciate Ken's views, but it's just impossible to imagine a life without flying.

I was pretty shocked to find out how environmentally inefficient to travel by airplane. One of the statistics that stood out most to me was that 80% of air travel is done by the top 1%. This fact completely changed my perspective in two ways - 1) if the remaining 99% of the population can survive without air travel, is there really a need for it? 2) even when I feel that I am not one of those leaving a large carbon footprint, it is important to compare yourself to the world instead of the bubble you live. Moving forward, instead of praising celebrities who own private jets to travel around night after night, I will question how hurtful this is to the environment. Though the solutions that Ken proposed, such as travelling bus or train or bike, would be extremely beneficial, it is definitely a very idealistic way of thinking. It will be difficult to convince those who have bee used to air travel from LA to NY in less than 5 hours to shift to a 3 day journey by train. As a result, it is important for us to provide realistic solution opportunities when considering climate change as radical changes may be demotivate completely to consider alternatives.

I agree with you. It's surreal to wrap your mind around how many people never have used air travel as a method as transportation and the ones who do use it so often! The carbon footprint of those who use travel is much larger than those who don't but they won't be experiencing the impact of all their travel the same way that those who have never traveled will experience it. Another point you brought up was reasonable travel alternatives that will work to replace airplanes and the appeal of fast travel that they provide. In order to do that there needs to be a much larger investment in this kind of transportation, something that just isn't happening at a fast enough rate. Plans to build high speed rails continue to be delayed or opposed in the US, citing high costs and the actual effectiveness of them. The California High Speed Rail is a train that would link Northern California to  Southern California, yet Governor Newsom showed less interest for this project than our previous Governor Jerry Brown. Additionally, this high speed rail would get from LA Union Station to Downtown San Francisco in 2 hours and 40 minutes, which is slower than by plane and more expensive.


<br><hr>

I agree with the two points you made regarding questioning whether air travel is really necessary and the second in which you stated that it is important to consider outside our own bubbles. In surviving without air travel, we should consider other alternatives like taking a train even if it is a longer trip. Taking the train can also be part of the adventure, because part of the destination is the journey, and in my own opinion it is a more comfortable experience than an airplane. However, I know people who would not agree and would much prefer to have a flight. In response to what you said about celebrities, shouldn't they also consider changing their ways? What if they began to bike or take a train to get somewhere? Yet, there is the question of how would we convince celebrities to change their ways? To add on, I also agree with what you said about convincing others, the general public. Throughout this course, I have been asking myself, how do I convince people to change something in their lifestyle in order to reduce their carbon footprint? In being realistic, some people won't change their way of life, such as their diets, transportation, or other forms of consumption. That is one of the things that we as students and other struggle with. So a question I live with is how do we convince the public?

I feel conflicted by this issue.  On one hand I am really disturbed by how much of a first world problem this is.  That we can't stop jetsetting ourselves around the globe to notice that our travel is suffocating it.  But realistically, we buy into a world where this is just standard practice. Though standard practices are no excuse for irresponsible behavior, we seem to have gotten ourselves stuck in a predicament.  Our world is more interconnected than ever.  With use of the internet there is essentially no spacial gap between any two areas of the world.  Interconnectedness defines us and this era.  And as much as we want it to be, the internet is not a real place.  There is no sustainable way to bring this closeness into the 3D world around us.  The distances we cover are staggering and it's no wonder each person who uses air travel is effectively pumping tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This doesn't account for any other aspect of the aviation industry and its other areas of waste.  It is shameful that we all consistenly put our lives before the life of the planet.  Humans are greedy and not very good at admitting failure so I don't see this practice changing any time soon sadly.  Much more dire situations will have to befall us to influence the reaction we need to save the planet.

I am not a frequent flier, but when I do fly, I have to fly long distance because my family is usually on the other side of the world. And there are thousands and thousands of people like me. I think it is almost impossible to make people stop flying to see their closest friends and family members, but it is possible to have a carbon tax that would depend on the mileage of the trip. I feel like this would solve the issue of flying somewhere really close, like from Los Angeles to Las Vegas or to Santa Barbara, because instead of paying additional money for carbon tax, people can use other ways of transportation like electric cars or trains and save money. But it would not change much for those who need to get to the other side of the planet. Since the entire world is so connected, it is kind of impossible to imagine how in this case people could continue to have any relationship with each other. 
    <br><br>
One of the other solutions to this problem, in my opinion, should be a limited amount of mileage people can fly per year. Since a lot of people in the US fly a lot, and sometimes without a specific reason, they could rethink their flying plans and use a train, which would decrease the amount of co2 we put in the atmosphere by a lot.

This video saddened me. I already knew that flying was the worst form of transportation environmentally, but I didn’t know that it could double or triple your carbon footprint. This saddened me because, while I have only flown a few times in my life, I love it! The look out the window over the clouds is unmatched and makes me feel so far away from my problems down on the ground. I’ve always wanted to go flying to different countries after college, but I feel that now those plans will have to change based on moral decisions.
    <br><br>

It was crazy to me to learn that 19/20 people have never been on an airplane. The US is definitely a hub for air travel, and it is scary to think that we are the role model for what other countries want. If people in every country flew as much as Americans... I don’t even know where we would be now.
    <br><br>

I want to bring up a topic not really mentioned in Ken’s video: shipping. This video focused a lot on transporting people, but what about transporting produce or manufactured goods? Not flying yourself is a great place to start, but it is also important to think about how your food and items are getting to you. We live in a world where we want our things shipped overnight right to our doorstep, and I just can’t imagine there is an environmental way of doing that. I would love to learn about that data and hear Ken's thoughts.

After watching Ken's lecture, "Flying, the absolute worst thing you can do environmentally", I was surprised how privileged I was, being in the so called "99 percent" club. Even though flying only emits around 2%, it still surprisingly has a profound negative effect on the environment. To think that the majority of flights are taken by such a small percentage of the world. I can kind of understand the slow travel movement, but at the same time, traveling from LA to a destination out of state by train or car instead of plane seems hard to imagine. Especially because many people are tight on time, I can see that many wouldn't be willing to waste that much time to save CO2 emissions. These emission facts really put your plans into perspective. Many people might be down to reduce their carbon footprint until they realize that their efforts can so easily be offset by a plane ride. Hopefully I can come around to understanding the slow travel movement and enjoy the time traveled, even though it's slower.

My initial reaction to the suggestion  "fly less" was flat out refusal. Flying is so quick! And convenient! And fun (for me at least)! But then I remembered the trip I took with my dad last year. We took a three day train ride across the country to stay with family for a week. The train ride itself was at least as memorable as the destination. The sketchy wifi meant we spent much of our time playing board games and sitting in the lounge car to watch the scenery. In the dining car we were sat with other passengers and heard the stories of total strangers in a way I never have before. So I agree with Ken. Train travel is the way to go. That is, if you have the time. Unfortunately, the general agreement among people in our society is that quicker is better. And I did fly on the return trip, because as nice as the train had been, I wanted to get home before I had to go back to school. I think most people are reluctant to be the trendsetters because they will be the ones going against expectations at first. Slow Travel, to me, is a luxury mode of travel for those who have the time and money to do it. For instance, the flight home was just a couple hundred dollars, but the train ride cost twice as much. But I will definitely do my best to participate in the Slow Travel Movement, because for one I think the experience is worth it on a personal level, and also because it is just so unarguably better for the planet.

My initial reaction to Kens video was very similar to yours, in fact, It took me a few hours to fully consider the benefits of a slower paced life (specifically in regards to travel, but slower in all aspects as well). Once I had mulled over Kens point for a few hours I had remembered all the train rides I have taken too and from home during this school year. What I realized is that I remembered them much more fondly than any time I took a car to or from school because the train offers a relaxed view of the scenery rather than stressful and dangerous traffic. After my mind had changed in Kens favor i found myself in a heated discussion with my friend on the subject, I arguing for reduced use of cars and planes for travel and he arguing for innovative use of electric cars and planes. He touched on your point about how slow travel is less efficient and more costly and I went quiet for a moment. But then I remembered a chief flaw in the rhetoric of climate change: when we arive at a problem such as the time and cost of slow travel we tend to give up "im stumped, it will never work, its too expensive." We use this kind of discussion to talk about a whole manner of things from travel to renewable energy. The important thing to consider when a problem like this arises is that a mass rise in slow travel is not the immediate call to action but rather the end game. The goal of the discussion is not to institute slow travel as the major mode of transportation RIGHT NOW but rather to convince people it is possible and that it is something they want. As we learned with consumerism last week, once we are convinced, society as a whole will work to implement strategies in order to make this new concept something that is possible AND reasonable.

Teleportation would be a pretty sweet idea. But for now, I think that flying is the one environmentally harmful activity that we must maintain, at least until aviation adapts to fully electric airplanes. Sometimes you just have to outweigh the pros and cons, and in this I would say that the pros of flying outweigh the cons. Throughout this class, I have learned so much about the harmful effects of ordinary activities, such as driving or eating meat, but with a critical lens you could make the case that something as plain as drinking lots of water is harmful to the environment because of the consistent use of the toilet and flushing with water. Pobody is nerfect. I've read some of the commitments on this video, and a lot of it are people apologizing or writing on how surprise they are that they travel a lot, of necessity or out need. But in Ken's video, I think he is more focused on introducing us to these environmentally friendly alternatives rather than demanding of us to choose them over conveniency. 
    <br><br>
It is hard to sell all of the alternatives he offers in this video as more appealing than the conveniency of flying. So maybe keep flying? But decide with the knowledge and recognition of these alternatives.

I dreamed of traveling across the world and go sight-seeing around Europe, go see the African safaris and meet my close family relatives in South Korea. This week’s lecture video was basically telling me to kill those dreams and stay put in California which I do not want to do. America is very impatient as seen with some industry's need for newer or quicker things like fast travel or fast fashion. Issues tied to culture are very hard to reverse because of the success or the old age that it has sustained. Regardless, our generation should still work to fight against industries that contribute to the climate crisis and vote to enact climate change bills like the Paris Agreement.
    <br><br>

While listening to the lecture video, I couldn’t help but think about the A-list celebrities who need to take first-class flights or private jets to take them to their next press event and such. Should they pull a Greta Thunberg and sail across the ocean every time they, for example, need to go from Los Angeles to London? Even environmentally “woke” celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio (who has his own environmental documentary) take jets and first-class flights to fulfill their hectic schedules if they need to promote their projects. I couldn’t help but create hypotheticals if flying was completely out of the picture for them. Not even just celebrities, what about those who fly due to work or go to see family across the globe in case of an emergency? Completely cutting off flying might be impossible-- or maybe I’m just skeptical of a solution. Slow traveling seems like so much work and very time consuming compared to one single flight to a different destination. Taking the bus or biking for closer (yet far on foot) destinations are definitely possible and better and easier financially to do but slow traveling to longer further destinations would not be ideal at least for me. 
    <br><br>

Since I am a poor broke college, traveling would not be a reality for me anyways. Maybe in the very far future but as of now, I can worry about reducing my carbon footprint by eating climate change-friendly and use public transportation more.

Being an international student that comes from the other end of the globe, air travel is sadly the only viable option I have for me to see my family once in a while. But my flying schedule is minimal: one round trip during Christmas, another one during the summer break. And I only fly economy. 
    <br><br>

In the US, transportation connecting less major cities is primarily by small aircrafts. Coming from China, I definitely have a say on this. Proudly, my home country has the largest network of bullet trains in the world. These trains could manage 200 mph, this seems slower than a 600mph jetliner, but actually, shorter flights are usually carried out by “passenger turboprops”. These planes are far slower than those fuel spitting counterparts. Plus the time saved on security and check-in, bullet trains have been an appealing option in my country. Granted, the construction of such a huge network of rails and trains takes astronomical numbers of funding and even takes the political structure of a country into consideration. But it is not hard to see that it is working and working well in my country, and it could be an alternate solution for flying in the US. Maybe short routes between popular cities could be built, say LA to San Francisco, or Chicago to New York? I can’t see why this isn’t a good idea.
    <br><br>

I love Ken’s idea of cycling to San Francisco, but let’s be honest, it is really just an option for avid environmentalists LOL. Taking the Pacific Surfliner train would be an awesome experience if there are no delays, and it is pretty affordable too.

Similar to you, I'm from the east coast of the US. Although I don't live as far away as China, taking the 6 hour flight to LAX is usually the most time efficient option for me. I have looked into train transportation, but that often involves at least two train switches and then taking a bus from LA to Santa Barbara. While this would certainly be better for the environment, and perhaps a wonderful adventure, it would be hard to schedule in an efficient way. So, I am unfortunately left with flying as my way to get from school to home over breaks. 
    <br><br>

I've tried to limit my flying and take other measures to lessen my carbon footprint. I no longer fly into the Santa Barbara Airport; I take the Airbus from LAX to Goleta and vice versa and then take the public bus to campus. Whenever I need to leave campus, I take the public bus or borrow my roommate's bike. Lastly, I follow a vegetarian diet and only shop for clothes when something I own absolutely needs to be replaced. Although these changes are good for the environment, Ken mentions that frequent flying essentially nullifies those changes. While this is true, it is frustrating. Flying is a part of my life that is hard to get rid of -- I need to attend school and I like spending Christmas and the summer with my family. 
    <br><br>

If there was a bullet train, like in China, from LA to Washington, D.C. I could eliminate my need to fly all together. Hopefully slow travel will become more popular soon. I definitely see the beauty of it, it simply needs to reach further around the US.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you. Ken’s lecture provides me specific statistics about air travel, which is exclusive to the wealthiest 1% people in the world. Also, the fact that 19 out of 20 people have never taken the plane shocks me. However, as an international student from China, I have to take airplane every year for at least 48 hours (two rounds) in total. According to Ken, I would produce 6 tons of CO2, which reach the limit of my three-year carbon footprint. The only things makes me feel a little better is that I always take the economy-class. I think other international students also face the similar situation with me and I feel depressed that I cannot change much about it. 
    <br><br>

I also share the idea about China’s bullet trains network. When I stayed in China, I frequently took these fast and efficient trains to travel. The train costs one 1 hour from Hangzhou to Shanghai and less than 5 hours from Hangzhou to Beijing. Similarly, I have tried to take train in U.S. for domestic travel, such as from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. I admit that the scenery during the trip is beautiful and I really enjoy those 3 hours. Moreover, I appreciate Ken’s discourse about slow travel, slow food, and slow fashion. Slowing down in our daily life could bring happiness and enjoyment as well as benefits for the environment. However, I doubt the feasibility of bicycle-travel, which is time-consuming and not that comfortable. It may bring hard work rather than relaxation, which counters most people’s travel goal. For most people who have to study and work, they might not have so much time and energy to spend on the journey. After seeing this lecture, I prepare to take mass transportation if I would travel during our spring break.


<br><hr>
I 100% agree with you in the fact that there are just some circumstances where flying is unavoidable. I really like the fact that you brought up stating that you are an international student and that home is where you are always meant to go back to, and flying is the only way to get there. Sometimes, there is a time-constraint that prevents you from taking the train to minimize the time that you are on the plane, and sometimes you just want to maximize the time that you are in a given destination. This is called convenience. Planes represent the idea of convenient travel, and what we have seen from this generation of technology and profit, most people will pay for convenience, even if it is a little bit extra. I know I certainly will. 
    <br><br>


Ken also brings up how biking infrastructure should be a little bit more developed in our country, and I certainly agree. I think that we do not put nearly enough infrastructural development in clean forms of transportation, which indirectly supports the use of fossil-fueled modes of transportation. However, what I do find a little bit ridiculous is the idea of biking from San Francisco to Santa Barbara and back. I understand that it would save the planet, but there are many people that will not do that under any circumstances. Even if it saves money, that requires a lot of physical demand and time - two things that humans are most stingy about. I think that proposing that argument as an alternative to traveling by plane is a little bit baffling, but I definitely believe that our country can do a much better job in providing better infrastructural development for clean energy transportation systems, such as Brazil with bikes.

A beautiful thing happens when people begin to slow down and do every activity no matter how mundane with purpose and intention. In our culture, we value doing many things within a small time window. This mindset of getting things done causes us to no longer enjoy the activity we are doing. We just want to check it off the to do list and move on to the next thing. For instance, I hate grocery shopping with my mom because she views it as a task, while I view as an experience. She'll rush through the aisles trying to grab everything on her grocery list, meanwhile, I'll take my time walking through each aisle and looking at the different products. I believe that by trying to get things done, people miss out on the present moment.  This "get it done" mindset is also evident with our air travel. People want to quickly get the traveling portion of their trip over with so they resort to air travel. I believe that a huge change in what our culture values must occur in order to get people to stop flying. And i think that this change in our values begins with mindfulness. If people are able to find pleasure in simple things like taking out the trash, eating food, or going grocery shopping, they'll begin to see the beauty in the bigger things like going on a vacation! As a result, people won't want to rush their trip. They'll want to be present and enjoy the traveling process so they'll be more likely to opt for a slower, more sustainable vehicle to travel in.

I personally can pride myself in having never taken a plane; however I won't deny that I will eventually wanna take a plane somewhere. Whats amazing to me is reading about some of the carbon footprints generated by stars like Jennifer Lopez, and just how much of that is made through flying. The worst part is that they fly private jets , so that carbon footprint is entirely the result of their greed. I read a tweet the other day about Kobe Bryants death, and while it is so sad that lives were lost, celebrities shouldn't be using helicopters to go to places that are easily within driving distance.

I had not realized how harmful flying is for the environment until seeing this video. It is a shame because flying is a convenient way to travel and makes crossing oceans a matter or hours rather than days or weeks. Taking a train across the country is much less practical, especially when people are flying for business rather than leisure. The amounts of time it takes to travel via other methods are significant and would extend many trips by days. In order to shift away from air travel we need other methods such as high speed trains to become feasible first. If other methods of travel can begin to compete with flying in terms of time and convenience, more people will look to these other methods rather than flying, reducing the environmental impact we have.

I completely agree with your statement. Our society is ever-changing at a rapid paste therefore alternative travel methods must be time-efficient meaning that trains, for example, will have to be engineered to travel at a faster speed.  Unless these transportation methods are changed to match the demands of the people, unfortunately, air travel will continue to be a popular form of transportation worldwide.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that other transportation methods will need more development before the public is more likely to switch away from air travel. As it stands, flying is the fastest thing we've got and I highly doubt that a lot of people will be okay with giving that up for the time being. My first thought when Ken said that flying could double or triple our climate footprints was, as he later guessed, "Does this mean we just shouldn't fly to anywhere anymore?". Mind you, this is coming from a person who has flown all of two times in her entire life. I can say with certainty, though, that I have a far better recollection of the many train and road trips that I took with my family instead of the flight to New York City that I ended up sleeping through anyway.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. I think it would be a great idea to start coming out with better ways of transportation like you said a high-speed train. Although these are accessible in other countries, I think it would be a good idea to start having some here in America since a great number of people like to travel. I always knew that traveling by plane wasn’t good for our environment, but what I didn’t know was that only 1% of people made up about 80% of all the flights. I think that is crazy! It is a good idea to bring in better transportation systems to travel across the US because it can give people a chance to really see what is around them and how grateful they should be that they are living in such a pretty country. There is so much to see and yet people don’t ever really enjoy it because they would rather have fast transportation (i.e. a plane) to get from point A to point B.

This video was very upsetting. I understand that flying is awful, but it’s so hard to imagine legitimately possible alternatives. My family is from the east coast, so twice a year I fly to Massachusetts to see my family. If I drove to Massachusetts, it’s hard to imagine that that would be better for the environment. A train would be great, but we don’t have cross-country trains.  A bike? Obviously no. Even if driving was better, it would take a week and would be far less efficient, and after gas and the lodging costs, would probably end up being more expensive.
     <br><br>

 I think my main take-away from this is that we need more trains. Unfortunately, in this country we prioritize cargo trains over passenger trains, so train travel is horribly inefficient. Even taking the train from Santa Barbara to where I live in the Bay Area can sometimes double the travel time. I feel myself losing hope everyday honestly because even though we know the solutions to the climate crisis problems, everything takes so long to be enacted in this country that by the time a high-speed, cross-country train exists, we’ll already be underwater.

While I have agreed with almost all the suggestions made so far in this class on how our society needs to change in order to reduce the climate crisis, I disagree in some ways with what Ken said in this lecture video.  I think that as hard as it will be to get Americans and people in other first world nations to make changes such as driving less, using local mass transport more, reducing waste and eating less beef, getting us to stop using air travel will be near impossible.  Why is that?  Well as appealing as the slow travel school of thought may be to some I frankly don't buy that it will be a desired alternative to the speed air travel offers.  We live in a world where within the span of 24 hours, I can take a flight to almost any location on the planet.  I truly believe this is one of humanities greatest achievements, no matter the impact on our environment.  There are so many places I would like to someday visit, and frankly I never would if I had to get there by train and boat, taking days or weeks to do so.  Now I am not saying that we shouldn't change the way we fly to reduce our carbon footprint.  People who fly weekly for work, or even more than once or twice a year for whatever personal reasons, need to drastically reduce their flying.  It is simply not efficient to live in one state and work in another, having to fly back and forth all the time just for your job, while video conferencing and working from home are appealing alternatives.  But overall it is unreasonable to think people will so easily erase the greatest transportation achievement of history from their lives.  I point to the statistic of planes being responsible for 2% of the worlds pollution, there are many ways we can try to reduce that (innovations similar to whats going on with electric cars, or super frequent fliers flying less)  but overall I still think that flying once or twice a year for whatever reason is entirely reasonable and at a certain point worth the comparatively small emissions.  The final thing I'd like to say is how you did point out that flying once to Paris would expend your greenhouse gas emissions for 1.5 years under the Paris agreement.  That is valid, but again that is giving an equal carbon emission standard for everyone on Earth.  Although in so many ways we have treated the poorest half of our world unfairly in terms of the climate crisis, and need to remedy the harm we have done while bringing them closer to our standard of living,  I am frankly fine with air travel being a select privilege I can enjoy.  It may be unequal, but there are always going to be privileges that are blessed upon some people of the world not enjoyed by others.  And while owning a massive house that largely goes unused or wasting absurd amounts of food that could have been given to starving people are practically slaps in the face to a majority of our world, I think the ability to travel by air is a totally reasonable privilege that those who can afford it should be able to enjoy in moderation.  Overall I just think that there are many more aspects of the climate crisis that should be focused on, and most cultural shifts that need to be made to reduce our carbon footprint are much more important than our occasional flying habits.

I agree. I have done about 4 roundtrips in my lifetime and 3/4 times was to go visit my mother and fathers homeland and visit family members and the other was for a volunteer trip with UCSB. To me, that is justifiable. But why? Why is it OK for me to feel OK about having air traveled after learning all its negative impacts on the environment? Before knowing all this, I booked a Spring Break trip across the United States and still do not feel guilty about it because I do not fly often. It is rare for me, especially because flights are expensive. As a society, we have been told and even encouraged to take a vacation and travel around the world. So, I find it quite difficult to let go of my dream to continue traveling. Maybe instead of taking mini trips every few years, I can do a grand one every 5 years like Ken mentioned. I just cannot see myself never hopping on a plane again as selfish as it sounds. When you mentioned that you believe it is a reasonable privilege I could not agree any more. In regards to Ken's question at the end, I feel like getting rid of private planes/jets would help as it is not a necessity. Those who partake in flying on private planes/jets use them for their convenience and because they have the money to do so, but is overall unnecessary, I mean they have first class for a reason.

I agree with your point that eliminating flying is not possible. There’s just not a better alternative to flying right now, say if Elon Musk built a transcontinental hyper train that is even faster than a plane and it works, people would love to take it. But building rails around the planet or burning jet fuel, which is better for the planet? To be honest, I don’t know. As technology progresses, we would have more efficient ways of travel, like nuclear powered commercial planes? Or electric powered ones? The demand of moving people far distances around the globe is just there, and there are limited ways we could reduce that demand, I think the best way to approach the carbon emission of flying is through technological advancement or the progress of other better alternatives.

I will be the first to admit that I enjoy flying. I think that the technology and the precision that goes into flying an airplane is fascinating. That being said, the more I become educated on the topic of the climate crisis, the more I see things in a new light. As naive as it is, I knew close to nothing about the climate crisis prior to this class. I come from a very small town with a population of about 7000 in the Central Valley. The climate crisis wasn't a topic that we discussed. My parents, both who hold college degrees, and my father a very experienced engineer and a money-saving activist taught me to ask questions and admire the work that goes into creating things. I am fascinated by the technology and the advancements that flying has made. I think it's incredible that someone figured out how to make something like an airplane and even more fascinated that it can successfully transport people across the world without huge safety risks. That's what my parent's taught me to ask questions about. They never taught me to ask questions about what flying did to the environment. I never thought about how it could be bad. All I knew was that it was so cool to be able to fly anywhere you wanted in less than 24 hours. Our generation needs to be taught to ask these questions. I think that this is more a problem of what you were taught in middle school and high school and we need to be teaching the next generation about these issues so that we can come up with something to fix it and we can pass this knowledge down to our children. Airplanes are contributing too much to the climate crisis and the scary part is that only the wealthiest of people are contributing to this part. They're accustomed to their lavish lifestyle and it's hard to break people from that. I will be doing my part to reduce my carbon footprint by not flying when I can help it.

While going to one of the top public universities in one of the most developed countries in the world, we might often forget that our circumstances are rare and there are millions of people who aren’t as fortunate in life as we are. I never put much thought into the percentage of people that are fortunate enough to utilize air transportation, but after Ken said that only 5% of the population has ever been on an airplane, I was extremely surprised. I didn’t think that the percentage would be as low as it is. With this in mind, knowing that air travel accounts for 2.5% of the total greenhouse gas emissions globally, with only 5% of the total population using it, this is just another example of how the wealthy are adding to the suffering of the poor. As we learned before, the poor suffer more because of climate change than the wealthy do. Whether this is because the wealthy have the money to pay for things like air conditioning and other comfort items, or because the more developed countries where most wealth lies is in areas of moderate climates, this imbalance is yet another example of climate injustice. In America, we’re known to have this image of selfishness and general ignorance towards underdeveloped countries. Our use of air transportation only underlines that disregard. At this point in the climate crisis, we can’t afford to spend any more time committing careless actions that are adding to our environment’s suffering. Just one trip from Los Angeles to Paris by plane accounts for an individual’s total CO2 footprint for one and a half years if one keeps their emissions to two metric tons of carbon per year, which is the limit according to the Paris Climate Accord. 

     <br><br>

Growing up I knew many people that would take a vacation during every school break, and maybe even two during the summers. Each destination required a plane trip and thus the emissions that go along with that. For many, it’d be hard to imagine going on vacation without the help of a plane. This mentality is what’s perpetuating this culture of consumerism. I’m not saying that people should stop going on vacations altogether, I just think that there are many ways for one to cut their emissions while still being able to travel. It’d be unfair to demand people to not go on unnecessary vacations because it’s very reasonable that they worked hard and saved that many so they can reward themselves by going on vacation. And they should be allowed to go and travel without feeling guilty about the damage it’s doing to the environment. In the lecture, Ken talked about the slow travel movement and how traveling by bike or by train is significantly better for the environment. Although, this type of travel isn’t always practical for the planned destination. A businessman who travels for work isn’t going to want to spend an entire day switching from train to train to try to get from Los Angeles to Texas. Not everyone goes on trips for enjoyment, so Ken’s proposed argument to enjoy the journey and not just the destination isn’t always applicable. Instead, I think that our technology needs to advance and come up with different forms of transportation that are just as efficient or more than planes. Even for the nonfrequent traveler who’s going on a trip, trains might not be ideal. From experience, I’m from San Diego and whenever I visit home I usually take the train. Despite it having an ideal view of the coast for a good hour or two of the ride, I’m always left more agitated rather than calmed by my train ride. There’s always some kind of delay that sets us back an hour, or a lack of appropriate seating so passengers are left standing for an hour until enough people get off to open up seats. What should be a calming ride is instead an irritating experience that leads me to count down the seconds till my stop.

A sentence Ken said was shocking to me: maybe 19 of the 20 people in a room have never been on a plane. As an international student studying in the United States, I have never seen flying as a rare thing. But when Ken mentions that flying is only a matter of the top one percent of the world, I suddenly realize that the impact of flying on environmental issues. Flying is a way of travel for the rich. The rich are also the ones most likely to generate carbon emissions. If the rich can realize the impact of flying on the environment and make changes, or even use their influence on the public to suggest that everyone reduce carbon emissions, it will have a great effect on environmental issues.

I agree with what you said. The rich really can impose positive influences on reducing carbon emission if they can realize what they have caused and appeal to the public to do the right thing. However, as an international student, I believe that we all have experienced the amazing speed of planes. On one hand, the fast and convenient airplane enables us to fly from China to the United States in one day and pursue our studies, but the downside is that we would release tons of carbon dioxide. On the other hand, we can use other transportations to reach the US, but the sad part is that if we want to go home and see our family, the slow speed may prevent us from arriving at college on time. What a dilemma.

I feel that how Ken says that flying is not talked about as much due to it feeling more personal is a good point to bring up. Many people do not wish to give up the luxury of flying to curb climate crisis, yet it is important to do so. This video was greatly informative and a step in the right direction; although flying isn't nearly the largest contributor to greenhouse gasses, it is important to be warned about its dangers so we as a society can approach the industry with caution. I appreciate the options the video gives as a middle ground to air travel. Much of the proposed paths of action are very doable, as opposed to avoiding air travel outright.

It is really crazy to me that air travel only contributes 2% . I would think it would contribute a lot more but I know that, that 2 % is really bad. I always knew flying is bad but getting the actual numbers is really out there. Of course flying is a very privilege thing to do because it is very exclusive which makes you part of the problem when talking about climate change and carbon footprint. It is crazy imaging that 3 tons of carbon dioxide to be let out to the on a round trip. That is crazy to me that people will have jets and get on them for simple trips. I can not imagine people getting on planes just to travel and hour away. It is crazy to me that only 1 % of people have actually gotten on an airplane but also flying is a very exclusive thing to do so having that 1% contribute 2% of the emission is horrible. But that is the reality of people who are very wealthy and have money. I do believe that people can make a difference by changing their own live styles. First of all traveling a lot less would be a start. That is going to be a challenge because people are not going to want to stop flying just because. I think that by changing yours you can really help out the planet. I believe if people think they can make a difference by making simple changings it would really help the climate crisis whether that be changing how your transportation or what you eat.

It is shocking to hear the statistics of traveling by coach and first class in a plane. As someone who travels frequently due to my parents's jobs, I am ashamed to hear the impact that I have on the climate just by traveling so much throughout my life. It is really surprising to hear that 19/20 people have never flown on a plane before. In the US, there has always been talk about flying to this place and that, so I, and I'm sure others, may have been accustomed to hear about flying as a normal thing. This statistic is shocking to me as I have never accounted for the people of other countries as well. Because of this, it is even more shameful to note that only 5% of all people on the earth are contributing the most by carbon emissions by airplanes. Knowing that I am part of the 5% of people ruining the earth's atmosphere is upsetting and encourages me to reevaluate the value of flying so often.

As someone who’s family that lives halfway across the world, it's very hard to imagine myself never stepping foot on another airplane. I have never flown anywhere just for leisure. Anytime I’ve flown its been to visit my family, who I can only see once every few years. I imagine in the coming years I won’t be able to afford to fly and see them in the first place. It's hard to tell people they shouldn’t fly ever again because for a lot of people it can be something very necessary. An example of this is that when my grandparents died my parents immediately flew to go see them in their last hours. What I think would be a good solution is to focus more on getting rid of unnecessary flying. Flying domestic is probably one of the most unnecessary flights people can make. Many people fly within California, and as Ken mentioned, its very simple and cheaper to take the train or even the bus. Something that I never really thought about is how many people fly for business. If we could cut out everyone that has to fly somewhere for work, a large percentage of those people’s carbon footprint would be gone. That sounds a lot easier in theory, but I just don’t see why it's so necessary to have people flying to go to meetings all the time when they could simply have a phone call. I think its a good thing that flights are becoming more and more expensive. This will discourage the lower and middle classes from flying, but for people who have enough money, it will still be an issue. I think private jets should honestly be banned. Nobody needs a private plane to take them somewhere that's a few hours away. It's purely an item of status and luxury that could be easily done without. People are always going to want items that they believe will increase their status, and I don’t think the desire to have a private jet will just go away if you tell people the environmental impacts.

I believe it's going to be harder to get people never to fly again than to tell then never to use a car simply because an air plane can do more than a car and it can take you further. People fly out for either convenience or to see new places but for regardless the reason is, I think we can use public transport until we can't anymore. We need to do our best to get the closest we can to where we're going by using public transit. Public transit also  needs some more positive opinions since a lot of people relate public transportation with communities of color or/and low income. On the other hand, flying is seen as practice preformed by those of high status and people also prefer to save time. I think trains and buses need to become more attractive towards the public so that they invite and promote a larger community. I feel like we can all agree that we want to go places and be adventurous but how can you when you know the negative impact you'll have on the environment. I also believe that we can compromise with this, we might not have to never fly again but just be considerate of how often you fly out and also practice using public transportation to get closer to your destination, not only are you helping out the environment by traveling by means of public transportation when you can, but you are also saving money and learning about the relationship you have with the planet and this country when you get to drive through with it, and it empowers you to change and take care of it more.

I believe that it is time for people to greatly reduce their air travel. The fact that 19/20 people have not stepped foot on a plane is very telling of the population that needs to make changes to their habits. While ordinary people also need to make changes to their habits of consumption, it is the 1% with money that are contributing the most tho the levels of CO2 admitted into the air. They are able to afford whatever they want and they don't think about the consequences of their actions. As Professor Ken said as well, we find this to be luxurious and strive for this instead of seeing it for what it really is, which is that it is damaging to our planet and selfish. 
<br><br>
The reasoning behind why people travel by plane so often is because they don't realize how damaging it is to the planet. People use airplanes because it is convenient and reduces the time of traveling and time is something humans find very precious. I personally do not fly often, but I have flown to places like Mexico in the the past. My family went on an airplane due to the dangerousness of going through Mexico with a car. I did not find the experience to be unpleasing because I was kind of freaked out to be on a plane and I have sensitive ears, so being in that altitude hurt. I have been on a 12 hour bus ride to San Francisco  with my best friend and we took public transportation while we were there. I found this experience to be really memorable. Although it took longer, I was able to see beautiful scenery that I would not be able to enjoy driving myself or  if I were in a plane. It was also a great bonding experience and it exposed us to more human interaction, which is always nice.

I was shocked as well to hear that more than 90% of the world’s population had never flown on an airplane. Though I’ve only flown twice, both when I was younger, a lot of my friends at UCSB are from out of state and fly home frequently, so I’m very used to hearing about air travel and I never really gave much thought to its effects before. It’s crazy to think about the difference in the dispersion of wealth around the world. Even my family, which is considered very low income in the United States, could probably afford to fly if we needed to. Compared to many other parts of the world, however, even the poor of the US can seem extremely well-off. Because travel is such a high-esteemed pastime, and because of the perceived luxury of flying first class, this has become the lifestyle many people strive to live or to appear to live.

<br><br>

I agree with both points you made: slow travel can be a fun experience, but air travel is much more convenient. Because of our fast-paced society, many people value convenience over sustainability. For most, they can’t take an extra week off to travel to New York by train, so they just take a plane instead. Convenience, however, though it may be the most important factor in the short term, does not make up for the long term effects of such activities. It would be more convenient to eat fast food than to cook a meal, because it takes a fraction of the time and effort to obtain it, but if you live off of fast food the effects to your body will be detrimental. In the same vein, if we rely on air travel due to its comparative ease, the effects to the planet will be detrimental.

I was surprised to see that flying has such a  negative impact on the environment. What was even more surprising was that it only accounts for 2% of the greenhouse emissions which is due to the fact that the wealthy are the only ones able to purchase such luxury.  Flying can double and even triple your carbon footprint by releasing three metric tons of CO2. It is quite frightening that a 24 hour trip on a plane can use up the recommended CO2 emission for a person for a year and a half. I believe that this video really highlights one of the messages that Ken mentioned in his past video, that the ones causing these problems are the wealthy people. In the video ken also mentions a possible fix to the problem. Slow travel may be seen as a hassle but the idea sounds like it would be a better experience and better for the environment. If people did start using slow transportations like bikes and the train it will also help the towns that were not widely known. Also, reduce the emissions that they would have released on a plane. Slow travel and slow food seems like a reasonable change that anyone can follow because people used to do it in the past.

I really like how you connect the idea that the wealthiest people contribute the most CO2 to flying and it is just another example. It only solidifies what we learned earlier in the class. Flying is a luxury and the people that have that luxury are the people with more money. While I think I could have guessed this, I wouldn't have been even close to thinking that 80% of all flights booked are only by 1% of the population as ken said. I also found the solution of slow travel to be really intriguing and definitely a good option. With that said, it seems that there are often times where people would say they do not have extra time to do that. For example, most jobs will only give you a certain amount of time off or you can only afford a small amount of time off so if you are going to visit family and you only have a few days or a week this may not seem like a great option. So, my question is how do we address the issue of extra time that people don't normally have?


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I was so surprised to see how much flying has a negative impact on our environment. Throughout my life, I use to fly to the Philippines about every other year and it never crossed my mind how I am negatively impacting our environment. Flying every other year is about more than how much an average American should consume every year for CO2 emissions as stated in the previous lecture. For every time that I fly to the Philippines, I contribute about 1 year and a half of CO2 emissions when Americans need to only average 2 metric tons of CO2 emission if we are to reduce the temperature rise. Flying is really bad for the planet's environment and the biggest concern is towards wealthy and business people. The wealthy would rather choose to fly fast, efficiently, and comfortably compared to driving. Business people are normally constructed to take airplanes for meetings or travel from business to business. But being able to shift the planet's ideology of traveling, is nearly hard to comprehend. The wealthy are too ignorant and consumed in their well being that they simply do not care about our planet.

The solutions, professor Hiltner presented make sense, however; if one is to practice these, one must always appreciate the journey and not the destination. Simply put flying less would be a great way to reduce the impact on earth but is also hard for many. I feel this is a hard aspect to grasp growing up in the environment that I have, but is achievable nonetheless. The pressure from this lecture video is hard to apply to one's' self but is something that must be done for the greater good.

Watching this video I was shocked to learn that 19 out of 20 people never step foot on a plane meaning that 19 out of 20 people are not contributing to green house gas emissions from air travel. Hearing that one trip on a plane will double/triple an individuals carbon footprint was shocking as it emits more carbon than allotted/person from the Paris Agreement. I myself have flown on a plane and while I do not consider myself a frequent flyer, I do know that I am considered more privileged than most when it comes to travel. Ken voiced that frequent flyers are the ones who make of most of the air travel as they account for the majority of the gases emitted into the atmosphere. 
<br><br>

When traveling to far away locations I too, just like the majority of the world's population, prefer a faster means of transportation in order to reach my destination faster. Taking the train in the long run would save the environment immensely as it emits less gas than that of cars and planes. Being a college student who has taken the train home, I understand why this form of transportation is not as desirable as driving or flying to ones destination. Taking a train makes your trip longer, sometimes double the time it would take to drive, it exposes you to the germs of those around you, potentially exposing you to sicknesses, and it is just as costly as a tank of gas or a cheap plane ticket. While I have slowed down my train use due to a few of those reasonings, I understand why using the train would benefit the environment and could potentially be fun recreationally. Ken also mentioned using electric bikes to travel long distances and while that idea sounds appealing I myself know that I would not be able to partake. Going to UCSB I feel that part of the culture of our school is biking, people don't drive often, they bike. UCSB is a very active campus, biking or walking to class has helped all of us students decrease our carbon footprint by a little, but that is made up for when traveling the sometimes long distance home. 
<br><br>

I feel that it would be extremely hard to convince people to lessen their airfare because, even though 19 out of 20 people never fly in a plane, planes allow for an easy travel and a quick getaway to exotic and far away destinations that, if needed, is accessible to all if affordable. The luxury of a plane sadly holds more meaning than the future of the climate/planet for the majority of the world and it would take years to convince people to make the switch, just like it has taken years to convert to electric cars (and not many people own them).

I also found it shocking when I found out that only 19/20 people have never stepped foot on a plane. At first I thought I heard this wrong in the lecture video, but it was in fact correct. I expected this statistic to be different because I know a lot of people who travel on a plane regularly. I knew flying was terrible for the environment but I didn’t know it doubles and even triples an individual's carbon footprint. I found it crazy that if you take a round trip from LA to Paris (which would account for a little less than 24 hours in the air), 3 tons of CO2 would be emitted into the atmosphere (6 tons if you fly first class). This may not seem like that big of a number until you compare it with the paris accord. The Paris accord states that everyone should keep a goal to only emit at most 2 metric tons of CO2 per year. The round trip from LA to Paris has already long passed the goal of the Paris accord. I do believe that flying is a serious danger to our environment and should most definitely be reduced. The question is, will people actually be willing to reduce their air travel? I have only been on a plane once (LA to Hawaii) my entire life. Other than this, I take other means of transportation when I take vacations. I think it is definitely possible for people to use other transportation options other than flying. People only use the purpose of flying because it is way more convenient. While this is true, it is killing our planet. As for other people, I do not think there will be much reduction on air travel. Last week, I commented that people will not be willing to give up their cars for busses. I still believe this and think it is true for planes. I think it is necessary for us to reduce the amount of flights we take, but I don’t think it's practical due to how convenient flying is. If there is going to be a change made, we need to take slow steps rather than making a big drastic change. However, there are only 5% of people who are responsible for air travel, meaning if we could change the lifestyle of this 5% we could easily make a change. This is a very small percentage and we need to try to reduce it and prevent it from growing larger.

I personally agree with your final statement about how hard it would be to change the minds of society and specifically the wealthy to switch to alternative rather than flying. As a whole society we do view flying as for the privileged and we correlate it with those that are wealthy just because of the expense and what we are constantly told to believe. For example, the fact that so many celebrities and who knows how many of the elitist class have private jets is insane. We see flying as the top tier form of traveling but we never consider the great impact that it has on climate change. I feel that this mentality is the same that we can place on many everyday things we see as luxuries or economic goals that we have. We always see the end but we never consider the means of it, and of how those things are produced or the effects on the environment. The impact on the climate is something we always tend to push to the side but we are so focussed on the now and what is fastest and easiest way to do something. The fact that private jets release so much CO2 in the environment but yet we look up to those who use them and aspire for that lifestyle, it really shows how mentally trained we are to ignore the impact on the environment. Now that we are in a different time, I believe, from that of which we were growing up in, you see a bit more mentioning of environmental consideration. Growing up I remember when we first had to get a recycling bin for the house and then one for compost. I was surprised and I asked myself "why do we even need that when we can just throw it away," I know now the importance that holds but I realize that my younger siblings that is the norm for them. We try to teach them from a young age to recycle and be careful with what we throw away. This gives me hope that maybe we can slowly educate the youth and through them future societies on being more considerate of our everyday environmental impacts.

I found it shocking as well that 19 out of 20 people never foot on a plane, yet it's perhaps one of the worst ways it's doubling/tripling our carbon footprint. Out of a family of 5, my dad and older brother are the only ones who have ever used air travel once or twice in their whole entire life time. As another college student, I am also someone who uses the train to get home as my means for transportation. Driving home would be about 2 and a half hours from Santa Barbara, however by train that amount of time doubles for me. I can see how for some people traveling through train can be a pain and all out a stressful situation, but by being accustomed to it has actually made my trips a bit more relaxing. Anyway I can reduce my carbon footprint, I'll most likely do it. I also feel that it would be extremely hard to convince people to travel less, especially if many of what society has taught us in viewing air traveling as only for the most wealthiest. I think the solution of the slow travel movement is perhaps one of the best ways we can reduce our carbon footprint. We'll eventually get there in making people aware and them actually reducing their air travel, however, it''ll just be a matter of years before we can get to that point.

For a significant decrease in air travel to occur, it would require massive cultural change that involved slowing down economies and changing the expectations of consumers all over the world. As for effective alternatives to air travel, I can't come to think of anything. Travel by sea has the potential to be a more green alternative except for the fact that cruise ships are already terrible contributors to greenhouse emissions as well as a slew of social problems. Innovations in the train industry could yield a desirable alternative to air travel but that is nothing more than speculation.

I agree that in order to reduce Americans’ collective carbon footprint there needs to be a serious culture change. That is the issue behind the abundance of cars, oversized houses, and worst of all, excessive flying. Owning multiple cars, living in a house with multiple spare bedrooms, and jetting around the globe for a “much needed” vacation are all seen as “glamorous” as Ken said, and the only way to cut back on emissions is to change the way that people view those lifestyle choices. For the case of flying in particular, the older generations are used to flying without any knowledge of the negative environmental effects, and even though the younger generation may now be aware, all they see on social media are pictures of celebrities traveling around the world in their private jet. Instead of flying being phased out it is instead increasing in use, as we saw China increase 50% of their flights in the last five years alone. I know Americans are not planning on cutting back their air time to make up for that.
<br><br>

The issue does not only lie in societal norms and priorities, but in practicality as well. In my opinion, people do not have an excuse to drive their car to work if there is some form of public transportation that could be doing the same job, but with not nearly as much of an impact on the planet. However, as you said, I do not see many alternatives to flying. Cruises we know are extremely harmful and most people do not have time to pull a Greta Thunburg and sail across the Atlantic. Ken suggested that people train part if possible, like training from California to New York before flying to Europe. However, that train ride one way is 2.5 days which would add an extra 5 travel days. People taking time off of work are not going to want to waste 5 sick days sitting on a train, when they could be adding that time to their actual vacation. Maybe that isn’t the most ethical, but it is realistic. I don’t want to be a pessimist and say we are doomed because we can’t control the need or desire to fly, but I truly think we should be focusing on other ways to control our carbon footprint. Even though flying is the biggest emitter, I would rather make progress in more obtainable ways than fail while trying to reach an unrealistic goal.

I was little shocked about the consequences of fly travel. When people mention the influence on climate change that vehicles bring, my first reaction is the gas that automobile cars emit are belong to largest portion. I do not think of the fly travel can have such serious consequences. On one hand, I think it is a good proposal that Ken mentions: change 2 short travel a year into a long travel 5 year. Decrease the unnecessary short travel and plan a perfect unforgettable long travel is an available solution to mitigate serious situation of climate crisis. On the other hand, I think it is a big challenge and more efficient to create a technological transportation to have less harm to atmosphere. This is the most basic solution to ease this situation. But before human can take a new airplane that has less harm to the climate, it is better to travel less with plane or choose to travel by taking train.

It makes sense that flying would be such a large contributor of CO2 emissions for our world. The machines that allow air travel to be possible are almost incomprehensibly complicated and of a huge variety. The airplane industry is less popular than the computer or phone industry to us everyday consumers, but their technological accomplishments are even more staggering and impressive, and their employment opportunities are vast. Airports, their employees, and their commercial appeal also add to the positive economic contribution of the air travel industry. As such a communal activity, it's hard to consider individual environmental impact as we board an airplane with the hundred other individuals also trying to travel long distances in little time. Additionally, air travel is one of those things that doesn't offer a lot of other options without a huge convenience sacrifice. My cousin flies internationally for work every week; he runs his social media based on his travels and makes the most, in my opinion, of the fact that he is financially required to spend a large chunk of his life right now on an airplane. I'm sure even if I were to send him this video, and show him how much worse it is to fly first class, he'd shrug his shoulders and still opt for the more comfortable travel, given his necessity to be on the plane regardless. Air travel is just as problematic as car travel, as it is so engrained into societal needs that it doesn't seem realistic to enact any large changes or alternatives. 
<br><br>

I, however, don't care about planes. Ken mentions his train ride across the country being a fond memory of his and I envy that. The amount of times I have flown to Missouri and looked out the window wondering what the heck was under us, and never knowing, is a little sad to me. I could be seeing so much more if I just took longer to get where I want to go. Traveling more slowly is cheaper and seems to be a better experience. Biking up the coast of California sounds like a wonderful bucket list activity, and that ideology aligns with the majority of recreational travel. But I highly doubt you would be able to convince a business man, or political professional, that they need to ride their bike two states over for their important upcoming conference. A better alternative would need to be offered, otherwise the actions necessary to create a generation of anti-fliers would require an entire shift in the principles of travel. Now that the world has been made so small to us by all of our technologies, it is much less accessible to take away that privilege from those who enjoy it. Like all other environmental threats, I think it will require great disaster or some other shocking event to coerce the public towards these "slow" lifestyle choices.

Wow, I did not know that traveling by air was so harmful for the environment. Although it is only responsible for 2.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions, it is still extremely harmful for the environment and is the worst thing you can do environmentally. Ken made a good point by mentioning that it's  an act done often by the wealthy, which means they should be the ones who are targeted by advocates. I also did not know that flying coach does twice the amount of damage. In addition, flying a private jet is also just as bad as flying commercially. Personally, I have not been on a plane since 2010 when I visited Mexico, so my carbon footprint isn’t as large as those who are constantly flying to countries across the globe. Now that I am aware of how harmful flying is to the environment, I will probably never travel by air again. Instead, I’ll either opt to drive (which is less harmful than flying) or travel by ship. Sure, my traveling time will extend greatly, but I think it’s worth it if the environment isn’t negatively affected. Ken said, “if you fly, you could be doubling or tripling your carbon footprint.” This quote stuck out to me and I will do my best to not fly anymore. I also appreciate how Ken mentioned the alternatives to flying such as taking a train or using technology to video chat rather than being  at a meeting physically. Another quote that stuck out to me is when Ken said, “life is about the journey.” I agree with this and I do think people should slow down and appreciate life rather than rushing to every single event or location. Hopefully more people see this video and can change their lifestyles in a positive way.

As I was watching this lecture, I really was thinking the same thing. I of course knew that air travel was really harmful for the environment, however I had no ideas that it was so harmful for the environment. I do think that the ideas that Ken presents in order to change the way to travel are reasonable and good ideas, but if I am completely honest I do not think that a lot of people would be willing to make these changes to the way that they travel. Going back to the main topic of this week, consumerism, I do not think that people would be willing to travel by train or only take one vacation every 5 years, for the only reason to leave a smaller carbon footprint. I think that this would not happen because of the sole idea that it is not glamorous or in trend to travel by train or not travel at all for long periods of time. Unfortunately, like Ken mentions, traveling by plane makes people seem like they are part of a certain group of people that are considered to be wealthy. I honestly do not believe that people are willing to give up this status is order to help the environment.

I was not aware of the impact that flying could do to the planet. I am actually one of the 19 out of 20 people who have never been on a plane. I however do not know how long I can stop that from happening. I have family that I would like to visit. It would require a flight to get to them. I know it sounds incredibly selfish of me but I also do not find it fair that I have to give up ever meeting my family. I do not plan on flying there frequently just once or twice in my entire lifetime.
<br><br>
I do not own a car and use mass transportation to travel everywhere else. I buy food locally and generally do not purchase a lot of new things a year. I feel like that would balance the time I do plan to fly. I know that Ken said that it would nullify all my efforts if I did choose to fly but if I fly coach and travel as much as I can on land I feel like it would be enough. He mentioned things like Face timing and video chatting but sometimes you need a little more than just a video with family. You want to hug them and be able to interact face to face. Will the climate crisis really worsen if I choose to do this? People all over the world seem not to care and if that means that world will collapse, why shouldn’t I get to see my family? These are the things I ponder about while the rich and famous get to travel or take vacations without thinking of their impact. The rich continue to do what they want while the rest ponder about even taking a flight to meet family they have never met in person.

I never knew how bad flying was until Ken's video pointed it out. Flying to Paris and back from LA is 1.5 years of greenhouse emissions allotted in someones life time and only 1% of people fly. Its crazy to think that this 1% population is contributing a few percent to the total allotment of greenhouse emissions. Imagine if instead this 1% was 5,% then those emissions would be multiplied by 5 and that amount would be a significant increase to the total global footprint. This goes to show that it really is a small percentage of people world wide that are causing the climate crisis today.  Flying in the United States is getting very affordable. Flights ranging from 50 to 100 USD are becoming an economy (affordable) option, so i only foresee that the Flying carbon footprint will increase in the future. Judging from the comments below, people aren't to happy to hear that in order to decrease their carbon foot print, they would have to stop flying often. As a person who typically travels by train and bus, i don't see this as a huge issue. The train is quite scenic to be and you have a lot of time to do Homework or read a book among other stuff. Same with the bus. Its also very affordable to ride long distance ground transportation.  When i read many of my fellow students comments I feel like now, many students are feeling the "shock" of what they must do to lower the total carbon footprint. It sucks but if you travel every few years to save the planet for future generations, save money in the long term, and possibly discover a new adventure and the natural beauty of our planet, it doesn't seem so bad.

As somebody who only came to the United States for college and has visited countless countries all over the world in the last 19 years - most of them not in close proximity to my home country in Europe - this topic is very conflicting to me. If I wasn't allowed to take a plane, I would have never had the opportunity to come to California to study and I wouldn't have the chance to go home during Christmas and summer break. Since I was very young, my parents always viewed it as very important and enriching for me and my brother to visit as many countries and cultures as possible. When I started thinking about studying abroad, they were immediately extremely supportive and encouraging of my decision. Moreover, I took a gap year after high school and spent most of that time traveling to different countries - including spending three months in South Africa. I am immensely grateful for all the opportunities I had visiting other cultures and I have met so many amazing people in all those different places. 
<br><br>
With that in mind, I couldn't imagine not flying anymore or never having been on an airplane. I would not have been able to experience half the things that made my life worth living - in my opinion. I absolutely understand the detrimental effects that planes have on our planet and I am definitely not a supporter of unnecessary, short-distance flights. Out of all the times I have been on an airplane, probably 90% of those have been 5-hour flights or longer - distances that are very difficult or sometimes simply impossible to do by train. I wouldn't say I ever took an "unnecessary" flight that I could have easily avoided. On the contrary, I am an avid supporter of taking the train as much as possible.
<br><br>
Ken's example of biking from Santa Barbara to San Francisco reminded me of a trip I took two summers ago with two of my best friends. Although we didn't bike, we took a trip all around Europe on a train. We made several stops, visiting about six different countries in less than three weeks. We spent the train rides playing cards, watching movies, or simply sleeping. We were never on the train for longer than four to five hours at once, which enabled us to stop at many different cities that we otherwise would have not thought about visiting. It was really an amazing experience - the traveling itself as well as the planning beforehand. We would spend weeks coming up with the perfect route and every time a distance seemed too long, we would simply make an earlier stop in another city on our way to our destination. Even countries that seemed inaccessible without a plane - like England - ended up being very possible to reach on a train. I don't know how many people know this, but there is an underwater train going to London, so we ended up traveling from Belgium to England by train. If you simply look at a map, that doesn't seem possible, but if you do some research, you'd be surprised how many trips you can make by train.

To be honest, I am not much for flying in the first place, I’ve only flown maybe three times in my whole life, However; now knowing that flying is the absolute worst thing you can do to the environment, I will probably keep this number below the double digits. I never really thought about how so few people actually get to fly in this world and put in perspective I feel kind of honoured to partake in something that so few do, this does not mean that I actually earned it but was lucky enough to be born into the circumstances. I’ve always wanted to bikepack across the state camping along the way and seeing different national parks rather than just flying or even driving to my destination. I used to always say that life was about the journey, not the destination, but I never really practiced what I preached. If life really was about the destination, wouldn’t that mean that life is really just about death, seeing as how that is the final destination of time. Instead choose, life, to slow down and partake in slow travel where you get to stop and smell the roses, or if you’re allergic to those, then stop and take in the sights, or if you can’t see very well take in the sounds of nature, or if you can’t do that either then you’ll get to just be and think.

I think one way Americans can significantly reduce the number of miles traveled by plane each year is with the implementation of massive train routes across the United States. If travel within the country was more practical and commonly accessible the need for flying within the country would become obsolete. This would make the idea of slow travel less slow and more desirable you get all the benefits of slow travel but without the need to extensively plan out your trip beforehand. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, the US has a culture deeply influenced by rampant consumerism that would make the switch from air travel difficult. It has become the norm of measuring success with things such as flying first class and owning a private jet. This idea constantly shoved in our faces is not only unrealistic but it is catastrophic for the environment.

Ken’s explanation of the environmental disadvantage of flying in “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally,” provides the viewer with a new perspective of our inconsiderate and privileged lives. This particular video rang true for me as I have flown out of the country several times, while not even considering the detrimental outcomes of the flights at the time. Planes are just too wasteful to be used often. While other forms of transportation, like buses and trains, are slower than planes, they’re far superior when you take into consideration how much CO2 aircrafts contribute to the atmosphere. This worsens the climate crisis and puts the well-being  of the poorest people on the planet at risk. While flying is an incredibly convenient way of traveling far distances, its end results are far too severe.

I definitely agree with you on how flying is a part of our privileged lives. Our society has also made flying around the world as the best thing you could possibly do. I see how it can be true in terms of adventure or fun, but environmentally, it is not the case. Celebrities and social media influencers are always flaunting their jets and the ability to fly around the country or world so many times in a week or month. There are Youtube challenges where people literally throw a dart on a map and fly wherever it lands. These actions are obviously done by the wealthy and the well off people who can afford it. Those same people are the ones who are oblivious to the climate problem and simply do not care. As Ken said, it is the poor people that suffer.

I completely agree that our society has over-romanticized the idea of traveling by plane. That, somehow, flying across the globe improves your status. This concept truly stems from a position of privilege. Unfortunately, there are many who don't have the same luxury of being able to buy a plane ticket. To make matters worst, flying is absolutely detrimental to the environment. This impacts the poor the most. This results in a vicious cycle of the rich worsening the climate crisis at the expense of the poor, who ironically, can't even afford to go on a plane.

1 thing that air travel has upon all the other means of transportation is that it is quick and it is convenient. Although I absolutely agree with Ken that if it comes to vacation days, it is better to make it about the journey rather than the destination; but when it comes to business meetings in foreign locations, one can not take it easy and enjoy the view. Thus flying becomes necessary. Don't get me wrong, I think that flying is really bad if you have your own private jet and travel internationally for luxury, but with those who rely on air travel as a mean for their jobs, it becomes a different story. This is the place where the carbon tax would be the most effective. With the carbon tax, people who travel via air for fun will have to pay a substantial amount every time they use their jets, and thus making the marginal utility of the flights become less and less. And the ones who rely on air travel as a necessity will be forced to cough up a few extra dollars that can be used to help the environment. This way, air travel will then become less and less popular because people do not want to pay taxes, and the ones who absolutely have to fly can contribute and repair their carbon footprint by paying taxes that will help the environment.

Who else thinks that the climate crisis can't be solved? I can't see a situation where we as a country stop, the older generations are too deadset in our ways and our generation the 'zoomers' are comfortable splurging insane amounts of money and posting it on social media. A monster was created after world war 2 and it wasn't communism, it was consumerism. The American lifestyle is American because we are the only ones who can reliably live at this level of wealth and consumption,  but what happens when third world nations try to replicate our standard of living? China is on track to become the biggest economy in the next 20 years and with that will bring new consumers who will follow the precedent the boomers set and they will reinforce it. This isn't only an American problem of overconsumption it will soon become a global problem of consuming goods. Flying is one small example of this eventually more and more people will start to fly as china is on track to become the biggest market for flights. We face a problem that we can't fix, we can maybe cut down the U.S's consumption but what about nations outside of our sphere of influence? We can't force change, we must adapt and I believe that we must utilize scientific advancements in order to fix our environment.

Although flying only makes up 2.5% of global emissions, the fact that only 5% of the population flies explains that statistic. However, because flying is such a large symbol of luxury and privilege, the remaining  95% of the population who aren’t flyers are slowly dwindling, suggesting that emission by airplanes will only increase from here. The harmful influence of the rich contributing to the climate crisis can similarly be seen in the whole automobile situation. I remember reading about how cars were largely an American and European thing around the 1950s, but we made cars seem so luxurious and cool that the rest of the world followed in our footsteps, and now cities like Beijing that were once large biking cities are now populated by automobiles. This also relates back to climate injustice because although countries like India are the ones producing automobile parts and living with the pollution that comes from the production, first world countries like America get to smooch off the riches and products from the work of poorer countries.

It makes sense that flying will produce so much carbon dioxide emissions for our world. The machines of air travel are complex and various. For our daily consumers, the aircraft industry is not as popular as the computer or telephone industry, but their technological achievements are even more amazing and impressive, and their employment opportunities are huge. The commercial attraction of airports, airport employees and airports has also brought positive economic contribution to the air travel industry. So I don't think we should give up flying even if it has a great impact on the environment. I'm an international student. It's hard to imagine how I would have come to the United States for months without flying? Our precious time will be wasted on the road, and what we can do in transportation is very limited. Our activity space is also very limited. A long journey is a boring and uncomfortable thing. So I don't think we can give up flying on a long journey. There are only two things we can do. 1. Make the plane greener and more environmentally friendly and reduce fuel consumption. 2. Give up flying and switch to public transport for short distance travel.

I feel so personally attacked by the title of this lecture video before I even hit play. In the past year, I’ve been inside an airplane at least 36 TIMES!!! I’m not kidding because most of my family live all over the world… Canada, Taiwan, Hong Kong… And I’ve also been flying domestically to attend dental school interviews from coast to coast in the past 6 months. Recently, I took an online quiz about my carbon footprint and transportation was the culprit of me being a horrible person to the Earth. For starter, I know I will not be taking any private jets in my lifetime. Being a frequent flyer and also a student in ENG 23, I’ve made so many changes to my daily life just to offset my carbon footprint through both car travel and air travel. I’ve changed my diet, decided not to buy anymore fast fashion pieces, and become more aware of my waste products including food and plastic. I know it’s not much compared to what I’ve done but I really like the idea of consolidating trips together. For me personally, most of my flying are obligated, but in the future if needed, I would try to work my vacation plans into these trips. I know I’ll be moving to New York in June so if I do need to visit family in Toronto, I would try my best to find ground transportation instead of flying if time permits. I think the biggest problem for me was time because I don’t mind Ken’s traveling plan. I like the lay back and slow pace style of enjoying the moment, but I am still enrolled as a full-time student while booking interviews across the country with a single given meeting time. I had to make it or else there would be no future for me and I wouldn’t be able to keep fighting climate change.

I understand that as someone that needs to travel abroad, it is sometimes required to take the airplane and is unavoidable. However, it is nice to hear how in your homeland there is a high speed train and you are using it a lot. Public transportation is indeed much cheaper and it is also very comfortable as well. So, when we are actually given the opportunity to choose, it is better that we choose one that would do more good to our environment. And it is very amazing that you’ve learnt a lot from the video and would re-evaluate your travelling plans.
<br><br>
I don’t live across sea but I live in the states. So I don’t need to take the airplane often. After watching this video and learnt how much greenhouse gases that can be emitted from the airplanes, from now on I would rethink about how I would make my travelling plan as well. 
<br><br>
Technology has been developed fastly, there are more ways we can choose on how to connect with people. And I hope everyone watching this video would start to consider slow travel and would do something to help with the place we are living.
<br><hr>
I appreciate your response to my original comment. I definitely have utilized the high-speed train in the past even though it’s a lot pricier than traditional train. I actually haven’t looked into which mode of transport would cause more carbon emission. This comparison reminds me of a traditional car vs. a hybrid vs. an electric car. Even though the more high-tech option is more environmentally friendly, the production of the vehicle might produce more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to offset its zero-emission goal. 
<br><br>

I understand that technology has improved our communication skills in terms of physical barriers. However, I value the face to face time I get to spend with my grandparents and relatives and my dad that I might not even see for more than once a year. I feel like my circumstances are special compared to other immigrants in the States because I’ve lived in multiple countries and my parents are from different countries as well. Thus, my family is scattered physically. This might sound depressing, but I feel like there will be less incentive for me to visit when my grandparents die and when I establish my own career here in the states.

Actually, the only thing that appeals to me in the video is to use social media meetings instead of physical meetings. Although the tech has been carried out for decades, businessmen still travel a lot partly because of their antiquated ideology that meeting physically represents respect. The same ideology applies to all those forums like G20, cities and nations do need to prepare a lot for greeting those big names while live broadcast can do the meeting part without much preparation. I think we still need to change the idea gradually, but I think in the future, it is possible to get rid of business trips mostly. However, as mentioned in the video 80 percent of all flights is for 1 percent of people, Ken still wants the rest 20 percent people who take planes for recreation to avoid flying, which, from my perspective, is not realistic. He mentions slow traveling, which can be a good way to travel, but people may fail to have so much time to spend on their way to the destination. Imagine I have only seven days and I want to visit New York. It is unrealistic for me to spend three days on the way just to “enjoy the view and experience slow-pace life”. People nowadays are far too busy to think about slow-pace living style. They have a lot of work and have to be fast, and therefore it is not really an appealing idea to ask them to slow down and enjoy the scenery on the way instead of splendid views at the destination.

First off, I agree that we can eventually weed business meetings from feeling the need to physically be in the same room as the other people in different cities, states, or countries. Sure, they feel it is more respectful to make their physical presence, but at the same time, they are highly disrespecting the earth. After all, Ken mentioned several times that flying is the worst thing you can do environmentally. His main focus was on regular planes. I say this because lots of times businesses take private jets to their meetings which cause far more damage to the earth than a regular plane, when a regular plane does extreme damage as it is. I can't imagine how harmful it is to the planet when people privately fly. I know we have the numbers of how many tons it disperses per flight, but we cannot fathom the true damage it does. I honestly don't see much validity to it either. I find the earth's condition is a whole lot more crucial as opposed to the respect people are looked at depending on their air travel and how they reached their meeting destination. Secondly, I couldn't agree more with the fact that not many people will be fond of the idea to "slow travel". Surely, that is the ideal situation to go about traveling, but it simply is not realistic. We can only hope that one day it will become the norm to spare the earth and do whatever we can to prevent extreme damage just for our own pleasure.

The climate crisis is a double-edged sword. On one end, there is the fact that many of the natural wonders of our world, such as the polar ice caps or the Maldives, are going to be gone due to climate change. People want to go see these places before they are gone. However, the only ways people can really travel to these places is by flying. This is where the other edge of the sword comes in. People recognize climate change is happening, and then accelerate it by using air travel. 
<br><br>


The "slow travel" solution Ken suggested to me is confusing. He compared fast travel to fast food and slow travel to slow food. I don't think this comparison is accurate. Slow travel can take, as Ken said in his SB to SF example, much longer than fast travel. Even the train, a slower alternative to flying, would get you to San Francisco the same day if you left early enough. His biking proposition, to me, is something that will never be adopted. People simply don't have six days to dedicate to travel. I get that the travel up the coast and the adventure there is technically part of the thrill of the vacation, but I'm sure people would rather spend more time in their desired destination than on the journey to get there. Because of this reason, I don't see travel as slow as Ken has proposed catching on. I do agree with slowER travel, such as taking the train, to cut down on your carbon footprint, but Ken's example here seems a bit extreme to me.

I agree with Professor Ken that the plane makes a lot of air pollution. One plane can emit 2 to 3 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere and think about how many planes will take off one day in the world. The number is crazy. 
<br><br>
We can have some solutions to ease the problem. For businessmen, when they have international affairs, maybe they can try online negotiation. For travelers, they can decrease the time they take place. If the destination they can take train to get there, they could take train. Although it’s cost time, it cheap and release less pollution. 
<br><br>
They're also a situation that people have to take flights. My friend’s dad has worked in Europe, and her mother was stay in China. If they don’t take flights, it’s hard to get the family union. If we just think about reduce footprint, and we can’t take flights. For some special cases, it will sacrifice their chance to meet with their family. 
<br><br>
I don’t think it’s possible to ban the airplane, the only thing we can do is to reduce the frequency of taking flights. As an international student, I have to take flights to travel through Los Angeles and Beijing. But I think I can take non-stop flights. 
<br><br>
I hope everyone can make an effort to save our planet.

The facts that I learned in this video were extremely shocking, and they did force me to rethink a lot of the traveling that I do. I love exploring new places, and I love traveling. However, I never realized how much CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere from one single trip that I take on a plane. Although I do believe it’s possible to reduce the amount of air travel, I don’t believe that it’s possible to completely eliminate it.

<br><br>

For example, I live in the Bay Area. It’s very tempting to drive 5 minutes to the airport and jump on a plane for 45 minutes to go home. However, I never choose to go this route -- I always find a ride share home. I know that traveling by car is not as environmentally friendly as traveling by train, but I also know that carpooling is a big step in the right direction in terms of helping the environment. When you really think about it, the total time that it takes to fly home is probably equal to the 5 hour drive home. When flying, you have to drive to the airport, arrive early to check in, sit at the gate, sit on the plane, wait at baggage claim, and finally drive home. This can easily take 5 hours, so why not just carpool home. This is an example of me reducing my amount of air travel.
<br><br>


However, it’s not possible to completely cut air travel out of my life. My grandparents live in Taiwan. Yes, I Facetime them every few weeks. But seeing your grandparents on a screen is definitely not the same as hugging them in person. I travel to Taiwan every other year to visit them, and that is definitely not a trip that I’m willing to cut out of my life. There’s just certain times when you have to travel by plane, and there’s no getting around that fact. It is 100% possible to cut down on my air travel but impossible to completely eliminate it from my life.

I completely agree with the idea that while we can make as much of an effort as possible to reduce our travel footprint, it’s never going to be completely gone. Much of my family(cousins aunts grandparents, etc) lives in India, almost a 17 hour flight from LAX. If I were to become as carbon free as possible, I would essentially never be able to see them, or learn about the culture and life’s of my parents, cousins, grandparents, etc. While it is certainly a great thing to be able to go through these experiences, it’s also very expensive to make the journey. Not only is a trip for a family of 4 easily around $10k when everything’s considered, but the time it takes to make the journey can be a few days itself. 
<br><br>

I do my best to take things like rideshares and carpool with my friends when going places, but I feel as if there won’t ever be a true solution to this problem unless the public transportation sector makes serious strides in terms of easiness and effectiveness for both short and long term travel.



<br><Hr>

I agree with your comment. Although air traveling contributes a small percentage as a whole, it is shocking that one person can double and even triple one's carbon footprint by taking a flight, let alone flying first class. I, too, never realized how much carbon was produced by each person. I can only imagine the tons of CO2 produced daily from just one airline. We should definitely consider our options before booking a flight and consider the different paths that could limit how much we fly. Nonetheless, I do agree with what you said at the end, it is not possible to completely cut air travel. My family lives in Mexico City and even though we facetime, it can't compare to a face-to-face conversation, thus I visit them once a year. I do stay there for at least a month, so that comforts me a little.



<br><Hr>
I agree with what you say. I also extremely passionate about traveling and for almost every time I travel, I would like to take planes. However, I am staggering of what Ken said in the video. 2 tons of carbon dioxide are emitted during every flight time. I never imagine what a large footprint I’ve made to the environment. I would like to change to another transportation like if I travel next time. I agree with what ken says that we can take a train first, then take or flight or some other better combinations. 
<br><br>
Also, I have to acknowledge that I have to produce large footprints because I live in China and I attend college in the US. Flying is always in my schedule and it is inevitable. I need to go home every year and take a flight to the US again. If I cannot avoid producing large footprints, maybe I can think of other ways or solutions to make an adjustment. I can take public transportation to work or buy fewer clothes. There can be some ways to solve it out.



<br><Hr>

For you, cutting out air travel is nearly impossible. But, I love how you said that you want to lower your carbon footprint in other ways because the elimination of air travel isn't an option. It shows that you really care and want to make an effort to help our environment.

After watching “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally” I thought about all the times I have flown in my life. One particular instance I thought about was when I played soccer and we had a tournament in Arizona and a couple girls and their parents, me included decided to fly, from California, there due to convenience. Even though some families were driving, which also isn’t the most eco-friendly mode of transportation, we decided to fly just to reduce our travel time. It really blew my mind when professor Hiltner provided the statistics that 19/20 people have never set foot in an airplane. To me, I never really thought about flying as a privilege, until this class, because I just saw it as a way to get from point a to point b. It really puts it in perspective when you think about 95% of people who will never go on an airplane. Although slow travel is a solution to the flying problem, however, I don’t believe it is probable for everyone. People want to get to far places in the shortest amount of time possible. I do believe that having fewer planes and fewer flights would be a good place to start to reduce air travel but I think it will be extremely hard to wean people off air travel completely or switch to busing and training everywhere.

Before watching the following lecture, “Flying, the absolute worst thing you can do environmentally,” I did not ever really think about how harmful flying is to our environment. While watching this video I was then kind of realizing how harmful flying is on the environment. I know this seems like the obvious thought that appears in your mind when watching this lecture video but I really started to think and thought about how packed airports are known to be filled with hundreds of people flying for multiple different reasons and some are frequent flyers due to work. It was shocking to find out that nearly three tons of carbon dioxide are emitted per individual just by taking a one day(24 hour) plane. I started to then think about all the time in which I took a pane and they were all obviously for traveling to places where I could either not drive to or it would just take a large amount of time to travel to by a vehicle. When Ken suggested traveling to new places by train, I  realized that a train may not be a bad idea. Traveling by train can be an enjoyable experience because to get to a destination you will have to travel through many other places and you can enjoy traveling through the different places experiencing many different environments, which you would not be able to do if you were just straight flying. So I think that would be a fun experience and think people should consider traveling by train more often. So I’m going to give this a try and recommend it to my friends and family and inform them about how harmful flying is as well on the environment.

The effects that air travel has on the environment is an issue that not many people are aware of—or at least it’s usually not the first thing that comes to mind when we think of living environmentally consciously. Professor Hiltner really put it into perspective for me when he revealed that only 5% of the world’s population have stepped foot on an airplane, showing that more than plenty of people on the planet live their lives without the use of air travel. 
<br><br>
I would say that for the average person, flying on the plane is an indication of some significant life event including weddings, vacations, moving, visiting family, going to college, studying abroad, and etc. It would not be to my surprise if people considered the environmentally harmful risks of air travel to be ‘worth it’ just as they do when they think of it in a financial aspect. It is difficult to imagine a world in which people who have the money and the resources to fly, to not to.
<br><br>

I agree that taking the train is a better alternative and that more people should learn to utilize and appreciate the railroad system, but we live in a time and a place in which people believe time is money. Taking the train takes far longer than traveling by plane and this same idea goes for taking the bus as opposed to driving. We must also consider that air travel is just about the only means in which one could reach destinations across the world. I’m sure that many prioritize the needs of their families and their own self fulfillment over climate change and although this is a harsh reality I believe that people would and will overlook the detrimental effects of air travel for those reasons.

I was very surprised to learn how little people in the world have flown. My mom flies for work every few months and I always use a plane to get home for the holidays. Flying caters to the American want for an easier and faster lifestyle. We are constantly ‘reinventing the wheel’ and coming up with faster and faster ways to get around. However, I actually enjoy taking the bus places. It makes me feel like I am on an adventure. In my lifetime, I want to travel around the world as much as possible. I can see that in order to make this possible, I should use boats and trains as a main source of transportation. I definitely think that the popularity of flying goes hand in hand with American consumerism. Being able to fly is a status marker and the higher class you can afford, the higher status you seem.

Sadly I think of myself as a frequent flier. I have traveled to many places across the US and the World via flight and I’m starting to realize it is very harmful. Now the worst part about this is that in the coming years, I don’t have much of a say in flying and I kind of have to use air travel since I am an out of state student. I live in Texas which is many hours away via train or car, and I have yet to bring my car to campus as I am only a first year. Furthermore I don’t even know if trains from California can reach Texas, but I’ll look into. Anyway, I keep seeing the negative effects of air travel and I really do want to change, so I think I’ll have to look into getting home in different ways. I don’t think my parents will be too happy about it, but I can at least try. My goal is to try and convince my family to do what you suggested, slow-travel as it looks like a fantastic time, while also helping to save the environment. My family really enjoys traveling and I can’t blame them as I do as well, but we really need to change as we are killing the planet. The solutions that you offered were all viable options, but I think the best way is to fly less. Although if you are a person who enjoys traveling then you should try a train or maybe slow-travel, it will probably be much more enjoyable than a cramped airplane. I have taken a couple passenger trains will vacationing and they’ve all been very enjoyable from good food to amazing views while playing board games with my family. I also liked the idea of towns playing a role in slow travel industry because it supports communities and helps to build the economy in places, plus it reminds me of the movie cars when Lighting McQueen goes to a small town and helps to bring it back to life when the city is run dead by an interstate that passes them by. To be honest Cars is a very good movie supporting slow travel and community that is caused by making a journey more a part of the adventure, and not just the destination. Now I don’t think air travel should be completely written off, but it does need to be majorly reduced.

I have the same feeling as you do! At first I was pretty confused when Ken introduced that air travel only contributes to 2.5% of total GHG emission. In my previous experiences, air travelling is now a popular way for both short and long distance. I literally travel four to five times annually by plane and think everyone around me at least 2 times a year too. But when I was exposed to the statistics that 19/20 people around the globe don’t even have the chance to step into a plane, I was really shocked. Suddenly, I feel guilty about occupying their public resources of transporting long distance and emitting double or triple times of CO2 directly to the atmosphere. In the past, I always hate what the 5% wealthy rich people are doing to the innocent 95%. However, now, when Ken said “if you fly, you are the jet-set”, I felt urged to change. I may not be rich, but I am responsible. Therefore, after the considerations, I find the solutions given by Ken, especially the slow travel movement, appealing. I will definitely enjoy the beautiful scenes along the trip and try my best to employ the personal approach in environmental protection.

The facts along air travel really shocked me. I knew it could not mean anything good flying a huge machine in the air but I had no idea that it emits 3 metric tons of CO2 for a normal seat to Europe and back. This number really took me by surprise. Also the fact that first class doubles this amount. Although it did make me feel a little better that I do not fly first class. Before ken even said it I was thinking about people I know who fly once a week for work. That for a meeting they are emitting huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Though facetime would be an alternative, I do not think many people would support that. This is because people would not think it is “professional” but what could the other solution be? 
<br><br>

Another thing I really liked that Ken said is traveling by train or even electric bike. I liked when he said it is not just about the destination. I found this very true, because your favorite place could be somewhere you stopped along the way. I think I would definitely like to travel somewhere by train and take a few stops along the way and visit places you never would've thought of. But sadly this does not answer the horrible issue of business travel. Because people going across the country for a meeting do not want to spend a few days on a train. Overall society will have to think of some alternative because flying cannot continue to emit too much CO2.

I completely agree with you when you said that most people would not be in support of facetiming instead of a person to person meeting. Most businesses work with other businesses, and it will not be enough for only one company to pick this up. This is because if only one does, the others will most likely not agree to Skype or Facetime due to issues with keeping professional. I think the best alternative is to find some way to alter how the planes are made (as it emits a lot of CO2 when this is done) and I think we need to reconsider how we are making our planes. If we stay environmentally conscious while crafting airplanes, the Earth will not take as big of a hit in terms of greenhouse gas emissions from flying. This is a serious issue, and just as Ken has said before... the United States has more than enough money to start trying new things in order to help our Earth.

This was a very informative video for me. I know flying is obviously bad because it causes pollution but I figured the issue was not too bad for commercial planes in the same way buses are much better than individual cars for the environment (bus = plane car = private jet). But yes regardless, the amount of emissions from any given plane is drastic in comparison to a car/bus. If we as individuals limit how often we fly that would be a great positive impact in bringing down our individual carbon footprint.

I do personally agree to the professor’s idea about travel less using planes and make our living environment a bit healthier. Along with the pollution, travel with large transportation like trains or boats can also serve as a catalyst for invasive species or virus to spread even more faster and wider all over the world, bringing damage to societies and ecosystems. However, unfortunately, for many people who need to travel a long distance, taking the plane is still the most efficient way for them. I agree that the plane generates many greenhouse gases while it’s flying, but I‘m afraid that people will keep using it until other cleaner and more efficient way of travel occur.

My father is a cycling enthusiast and he once spent a month cycling across China with his club. He has the same point of view as Ken that the destination of a trip is important but enjoying the beautiful scenery along the way and getting to know the local customs are another treasures to have. If we can make ourselves some meaningful memories meanwhile protecting the environment by slow-traveling, why don’t we give it a shot? Besides that, after learning that traveling from Los Angles to Paris within a little under 24 hours would use up a person’s maximum climate footprint a year, which is two metric tons of co2, I felt ashamed. As an international student, the decision of studying abroad sadly requires me to fly 13 hours to the United States and back every year. It’s crazy to think that back in high school I used to fly back and forth during Christmas, spring break, and the summer due to homesick. Yet now I know the facts behind the flying and how much carbon dioxide would actually be emitted to intensify the climate crisis; therefore, I would definitely decide my trips more wisely in the future.

Before watching the lecture instructed by Prof.Ken “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally”, I never counted the number of flights I would take per year. In addition，the airplanes are being considered the greatest invention ever in 20th century in my mind since it greatly shortens one’s travel time and fatigue on trip. Nowadays, one can reach America from China, half a world away, in merely 13 hours comparing to taking a ship and drifting on the sea half of month, how can one tag a bad label on the airplane? 
<br><br>

However, after watching Ken’s lecture, I am shocked by the fact that the flights are the No.1 transport that bring up the irreversible pollution to our earth. As for me, as an international student who study at UCSB, I will fly from China to US at four times per year. Not to mention the flights I take within the China. Due to the fact that my parents work in different cities, I am a frequent flier even within the China. Certainly, there are alternative means of transportation like Prof.Ken mentioned in the lecture; whereas, I never thought about them since taking airplanes is the most convenient way. I am reluctant to spend several hours on the way from Chongqing to Shanghai. I even considered it as a completely waste of time! 
<br><br>

Ken’s video shifts my attitudes towards trains and high-speed rail. Although I have to spend several more hours are those transportations comparing to airplanes, I also reduce the emission of Co2 since those transportations will emit far less exhausted gases than airplanes, a way for me to contribute my strength on reducing the global warming. Even though it is a long trip, I can also enjoy the scenery along the way!

3 tons. First class is twice as bad. Personal jets are insane. Other gases
<br><br>
19 out of 20. Even half of americans.
<br><br>
I am not a frequent flyer, but for my age I have flown many many times. I like the freedom of flying but I have been thinking more and more that I need to cut down. The fact that 19 out of 20 global citizens have never been on a plane really puts it in perspective. My fellow Americans and I really rely on our free and consumptive way of life, and we'd have to change a lot in order to cut that down. I also didn't know planes emit more than CO2, interesting fact
<br><br>
Also that in flying from LA to pairs expends one full year of CO2 footprint for a person is a terrifying fact. I wonder if we have a plan for making sustainable air travel. I haven't heard much about it.

<p>

I have personally only flown a couple of times and learning how bad it is for the environment makes me really sad. Flying and traveling is such an amazing experience that it's one thing that's hard to give up, going vegan has been easier. I do not fly frequently but some have to because of jobs or other personal reasons. Rich people who fly private jets everyday are the ones who irritate me in this situation. They are polluting the air so much, just because they can, that this is the main reason I think a carbon tax should be implemented, even if only for this reason. 80% of flights are made by the 1% and I think there would be no other way to make them think twice about it, flying private jets everyday is not reasonable whatsoever. 
<br><br>
Sometimes flying is the only way to get from place to place for some people and that is what makes it so difficult. Some people do not have the money to take extra days and money to prevent a layover by riding a bus across the country. This is the sad truth. We need more practical and affordable alternatives asap like efficient trains or even thinking about fuel alternatives. I don't know how else to practically approach this.

I agree, as someone who has also flown only a few times in my life I was surprised how much of a toll on the environment my few times flying has caused. I know my carbon footprint from flying is not as large as a lot of people but the majority of the population has never even flown in their life, flying is an act of privilege. The pollution that flying causes is not worth the time it saves, I wish we had a better train system that could service the united states better. Flying is convenient but not a sustainable practice, we must find new ways to travel. The decision about flying is tough because sometimes is one of the only possible ways to travel. I agree that there should be a carbon tax implemented because of the major toll it has on the environment. I will consider my travel choices better now that I know the consequences of flying and I hope that many other people will reduce their flying status and go towards more eco friendly way to travel.

I truly agree with Ken that air travel is a bad idea, and airplanes release a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, airplanes are probably one of the most efficient transporter to help people to cross oceans or continents. It is very difficult for me to imagine taking a 3-month trip on a boat to visit my family in Asia. Or take a 3-day road trip to visit my parents in New York. People rely on such technology for traveling, and it is very hard to avoid air travel. However, I do think there are alternative ways, or at least directions, for us to help reduce the CO2 release.
<br><br>

Ken mentioned that "flying in first-class is twice as bad", which I do agree a lot. And this is a great tip for airlines and aircraft manufacturers. By simply reducing the number of first-class seats or just replacing first-class with economy seats will make the flight more efficient and more environmentally friendly. The other possible way to overcome the greenhouse gases is developing better transportation. This is highly possible to replace the airplanes today. Being the president of The Aerospace and Aviation Club, I know that scientists and engineers have already invented a new-era airplane that powered solely on solar panels. Even though this technology is still very new and takes a long time to be available in civil aviation, solar airplanes are still a chance for humans to save our world and still have the freedom to be travellers.

<p>
In the video, Ken explained why is air travel so bad as it only emits about two percent of greenhouse gas which contributes far less than automobile use or eating beef. Personally, a single flight can cause large damage to the environment. Even though you are doing various things like eating plant-based diet and using public transportations, flying would nullify all the effort you make towards protecting the environment. However, it seems that there has no alternative approach that is quick and convenient enough to replace the air fly. If people choose trains or ships instead, it means we are going to live in a more primitive way discarding the convenience of technology we have already invented. Thus, there will be less incentive for technological advancement.

(Ken, I know I am replying to one of my classmates, but I suggest you read this)
<br><br>
I have no idea on what new travel ways can replace flying.
<br><br>
It seems like Ken highly recommends not travel by airplane, instead, travel by train or by bike.
<br><br>
Well… I think it depends on places…

I have been America for two years. Because the university doesn’t allow students stay in their dormitory in long vacations, students have to go home or travel. Thus, I am very very good at travel. Here is my suggestion: DON’T travel by train in America. This is not in China. Amtrak Train NEVER run on time. If your journey is short, it doesn’t matter whether the train is on time or not because who cares a two hours trip. However, if your journey is long and requires changing trains, you never gonna make it to the second train. I planned to go to Boston from Santa Barbara and then went back to Santa Barbara last spring break by train. I was supposed to stop at Chicago and take another train to continue to go to Boston. However, the first train, from SB to Chicago, was running late, and I didn’t catch the second train from Chicago to Boston. At the same time, they somehow canceled the train from Boston to Chicago which I need to take to come back. I had to cancel my fourth train from Chicago to SB, and stayed one more day in freezing cold Chicago, and fly to Boston for two more freezing cold days, and then fly to Los Angeles! Because it would be too expensive if I fly to SB directly. I bought the airbus ticket from LA to SB in the end. This is my adventure. WOW.

As sad as it is, the more and more I learn about the climate crisis the more that I think we might really just be screwed. Since eighty percent of flights are made by one percent of the planet, and we know that one percent is not willing to change, we as a generation are just truly screwed. Even though the switch to doing one big trip every five years is easy for most people, I doubt they will even stop to consider changing their ways. It seems like everything that we do in society pollutes the air greatly even without our knowledge. The fact that five percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from the production of cement is surprising since it would never even cross my mind to begin to think about the production of cement. This is a fault in my own mind process since I am trying to become more environmentally conscious. With that said, the knowledge that I gained from this video will make me inform my parents about airplane travel in relation to the environment and hopefully encourage them to travel more sustainably. Saving up for a big trip every five years instead of traveling more often is appealing but the fact that it is reducing my carbon footprint is the main reason why I will adopt this. This is another reason why I strongly believe that climate change education is so critical to the change we need to see in society. If people understood the complexity of the issue and the truth behind not only the science but how to combat climate change then we could produce actual results. Every week I think about how different our world would be currently if even half of the country took this class. I have shared the website with many of my friends and educated my parents which even led them to becoming vegan. The main issue in my opinion is that people are unaware of the simple things that they do not think twice about which greatly increases their carbon footprint like flying. However, I sadly can not envision a future where people will take an eight hour route to get to San Francisco from Los Angeles even though it is so close. This could be in part to my own mindset, but I understand the practicality but if people do not care the bottom line is that they will not change.

The statistics that Ken presented in this lecture left me surprised. I had no idea that 80% of air travel is done by the top 1% in the world. Although, when considering the scope of the entire world, this makes sense, it blew my mind that flying is horrible for the environment, despite it only contributing 2 to 2.5% of CO2 emissions per year. 

<br><br>

I have family members who live in Arizona, and my immediate family used to fly to visit them every summer. As I got older, I began flying by myself to see my family, and it got to the point where I really enjoyed flying. I would take a nap on the plane and within two hours, I’d be in a completely different town over 800 miles away. Planes amazed me because of their efficiency and ease. Yet now I’m beginning to reconsider my fascination.
<br><br>


I appreciated Ken providing us with alternatives to flying. While they seem like fun and fulfilling ideas in theory, in practice, I don’t think it’s functional. My dad, for example, is a very frequent flyer due to his job requiring him to be present for meetings and such at his company’s several office locations. Flying allows him to reduce his time away from our family without sacrificing the duration of his business trip. If he were to put into practice some of Ken’s recommendations, he would be traveling for a longer amount of time than he would be physically present at his destination. This makes me grateful for the invention of the plane and its accessibility because it allows my family to spend more time together. I understand that it’s very much possible to go deeper and fix the root problems in this scenario, but it’s not in mine or his control. 
<br><br>


I personally believe that Ken’s ideas for alternative forms of transportation are very doable when it comes to vacations. This summer, I took a train from San Jose to Portland instead of flying in a plane. It was a very beautiful experience, as we were able to admire the vast forests of northern California and Oregon. Little did I know I was doing a favor for the environment by foregoing air travel. While I’m not sure if traveling by plane can become completely prevented, I think it’s a great idea to encourage people to take advantage of prioritizing their journey instead of being anxious to get to their destination, as it’s beneficial to the person and the environment.

While air travel may only be 2% of greenhouse gas emissions, this is definitely not a statistic  that we can simply dismiss since air travel may continue to rise to more users and become more dependent on over the next decades. Similar to the use of cars, transportation is greatly done through driving and the emissions created by this high amount of usage is continuing to soar due to more and more people using cars. As air travel was stated by Ken to have increased by 50% in just 5 years in China, we must consider how this increase will continue to take place among the entire globe, which will only increase that 2% of all greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br><br>

Personally, my family does not travel by plane or vacation outside our state as much so I don’t have the same reliance or value for planes that others may have. However, if I were to say visit relatives out of country or travel somewhere I have always wanted to go, I understand how difficult it would be to find such an alternative. As Ken stated, slow travel movement is a great alternative through something like the use of train, but I don’t see how applicable this can be when it comes to going out of state as travel by boat would still release a portion of pollution as well. I believe a change that could be applicable is only through technological innovation that would create an environmentally friendly alternative in which people can still keep their lifestyle of traveling frequently or when needed while not leaving a carbon footprint through air travel. But until then, I believe slow travel is definitely the immediate solution as we can ask yourself before going somewhere “How is this affecting the environment” or “Are there other efficient and environmentally-friendly ways I can go?” By doing this, we can adjust our travel to somewhere under a day a way or similar by preparing in advance through modes of transportation like driving a car, bus, subway, or train. Also, something I was wondering was how does flying first class specifically double the amount of CO2 released?

<p>
In this lecture, one sentence that surprised me most is that 19 out of 20 people have never ridden a plane. This is like saying that only 5 percent of the CO2 emissions are put by half of the population. I am somewhat ashamed of myself for always thinking that flying is the fastest and most convenient way of traveling. This is a trend. If more and more people found that flying is better than other transportations, maybe this is what the companies are trying to do, there will be more and more planes and flights. The emissions are going to increase and it’s going to hurt the environment. In fact, now, according to the lecture, the people who traveled by planes have increased by 50 percent in China. People need to realize the cost of that is not only a ticket for a seat in the plane.

<br><br>

I also found that the suggestions that professor Ken made is very appealing. I have heard the beautiful coastline of California, but I haven’t got a chance to go and see it. A friend of mine told me that Amtrack in California goes beside the coastline. I really want to try it and enjoy this “slow” trip, and I hope that I can change my hobbit of taking planes on a trip after this beautiful ride.

The way that you pointed out that companies will try to market flying as the best transportation method in speed and convenience makes me think that the airline industry is very similar to the automobile industry. Cars are used instead of public transportation, mainly, because of those two factors, which are reinforced in advertisements. And because of this positive perception of cars, other countries have also started favoring cars as well. If airlines are able to market airplanes in the same way as cars, as countries amass more wealth, air travel will become more popular all around the world. This has already been occurring in China, as the video mentions. Airplanes are environmentally destructive, but because a small proportion of the world’s population use them, the carbon footprint has not been as high as other things. But, if they start becoming as desirable and accessible as cars, they could very well be even more environmentally impactful.
<br><br>
Also, your idea about seeing California’s coastline with an Amtrack seems like a good reflection of how we can still enjoy the things we want in a way that is better for the environment. Even though there are many car commercials showing the independence of cruising down the coast in a small car which has a significant environmental impact, cars are not necessary for such things as the same can be done with mass transit like trains.

This video was very shocking considering that Ken refers to people who fly a couple of times a year to be among the 1%. I consider myself to be of low middle class and I can say that I fly once a year or about every other year with my family of nine and would never before have considered myself to be among the 1% in any context. I would imagine that my family and I travelling to Hawaii every other year to be extremely harmful after careful consideration of this lecture video. Now that I know the extreme negative effects of air travel in any amount and that less than five percent of the world has ever flown I now understand how the one percent was calculated. This video greatly discourages me from air travel but I was a little frustrated to hear how inconvenient the alternative, “slow travel” options were. I have grown up with this idea in my mind that technology was amazing and would allow me to see the world and experience other cultures and sceneries and expand my knowledge. But, now that I know how harmful it is for the earth I am greatly saddened. Are we never supposed to see other destinations overseas and remain in a certain radius of the world for our entire lives? How would global knowledge and culture be affected by this transition? Would it be negatively affected?



</p><hr>



<p>

Up until this point in the course, I found that I generally agreed with the majority of lectures that Ken has put out; however, I felt that this lecture was entirely unrealistic in the scheme of the modern world. Ideally, yes, air travel would not be as present in our society given its rapid negative environmental impact but it has become so ingrained in the fabric of fast travel that there is not an easy route out of the reliance on this mode of transport. Additionally, I do think that the concept of splitting up travel to include more environmentally friendly options is a good compromise for people, one step closer to slow travel without suggesting the furthest extreme. I believe that suggesting the extreme of slow travel in cases such as biking from Santa Barbara to San Francisco will merely isolate anyone who is on the fence about making changes to reduce their carbon footprint as it seems as though the only solution is a drastic lifestyle change which realistically will not work on the average person.

I do agree that it does seem impractical to pull off, especially when traveling overseas. However, the mentioning of slow-travel is an effective way to combat part of the problem with CO2 emissions from flying. I definitely think that mass transportation needs to be promoted more, and have much more improvements to it, like bullet trains. Personally, for me, I rarely go on an airplane because I have never traveled overseas, but after seeing this lecture, I will consider the effects on the planet before I travel.

In this lecture, Ken once again presents a climate-related topic I was completely unaware of. Honestly, I had never really thought of the effects of flying, I just assumed since my family doesn’t do it too often it wasn’t that big of a deal. Yet I was so wrong. I don’t like flying anyway so this is all the more reason to cut those unnecessary plane trips out of my life. The statistic that really got to me is that 19/20 people have never even been in an aircraft. That is just crazy to me, flying seemed like such an average thing, I assumed at least 30-40% of people would have been on at least one flight. That truly puts the luxury of flying into perspective. In addition, I completely agree with Ken’s point on the Kardashians and anyone else abusing the earth by flying. There should be an award for that! And not a positive one. I completely agree as well with the unnecessary business flights that happen. So many people use business as an excuse to fly somewhere. We literally have Zoom, Skype, Slack, and so many other tools that allow for remote work and communication. This lecture put a lot of perspective on the climate crisis and really illustrates the things we take for granted in the US that cause us to contribute so much the CO2 emissions. It is definitely a goal of mine to fly less in my lifetime.

I completely agree with everything you spoke of above. I was completely unaware of how small the amount of people that fly actually is. I personally also dislike flying, and my family was never big on it either, so I too believed that (to quote you) "it wasn't that big of a deal." I wish there was a way to promote this information in airports, as I feel that many people are unaware of how detrimental flying is to the environment. This brings me back to the idea of treating fossil fuel release like cigarette smoke. Perhaps putting warning labels around things that use large amounts of Green House Gases could have an impact on the American's conscience. I think that if every time people got on a plane they saw the amount of gases they personally released from flying, change could be possible. 
<br><br>

My family has always tried to stay away from flying if it wasn't necessary, because not only is it bad for the environment, it's expensive too. I have a lot of family here in Southern California, but I'm from San Francisco. My family has hardly ever flown to visit our family here, but rather planned road trips each time we'd travel. Along with this, when I drive home to San Francisco from Santa Barbara over break, I make sure to make a public post seeing if anyone wants to carpool to the Bay Area. This limits the amount of gas used, as well as money spent. Plus, carpooling is far more fun than driving alone. Helping the environment is a win win situation, and people need to start seeing it as such. 
<br><br>

As a freshman in the Santa Catalina dorms, every hour or so a loud obnoxious plane flies by my window. Before, I thought of it as just a nuisance. Now, every time I hear one, I will think of the tons and tons of gasses being released into the atmosphere. I know this will make me distressed at first, imagining the impact all of these planes have on our atmosphere, but I know it will also keep the fire within me kindling, urging me to continue fighting for the climate crisis.





</span></div><hr>



<p>

When I heard that air travel contributed only 2.5% of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, I did not get how it could be so terrible as it seems that other things contribute so much more to the amount of greenhouse gases.  But, after watching this video, I see how air travel could be contributing to the climate crisis.  
<br><br>
I believe that it would help greatly if we embraced the idea of slow travel.  As transportation becomes more efficient and streamlined, people become less interested in the traveling part of travel.  People today see the process of getting from one place to the other as a hassle and only look forward to arriving at their destination.  Taking a train from one place to another would seem like a waste of time because traveling by plane is much quicker.  Furthermore, if slow travel becomes more popular, more money would be spent on improving transportations systems, which in turn would encourage more travel by train or bus.
<br><br>
It is unfortunate that most people will not consider their carbon footprint when making their travel plans.  Who would want to worry about CO2 emissions when you are trying to enjoy a vacation?  If you have to travel for work, you do not really have many options for traveling if you are on a time crunch, so traveling by plane would be the way to go.
<br><br>
I do not believe that dealing with air travel is something we should focus on in order to deal with the climate crisis.  Although many other places are increasingly using air travel, I believe that at the moment, we should be focusing on things that are already contributing greatly to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rather than focusing on something that will gradually contribute more as more people have access to it.

I agree with your comment that air travel shouldn’t be at the top of our lists when trying to tackle climate change. Yes, one flight is awful for our individual carbon footprints, but when only the top 1% are frequent flyers, and in total air travel only contributes 2.5% to greenhouse gases, it is hard to say that this is a global issue to undertake at the moment. If anything it is important to wean ourselves off of flights overtime and invest in railroads and bus routes, but I feel like it should be near the bottom of our lists right now when we have just learned about the ills of the fast fashion industry, agriculture and livestock, and oil and gas corporations. Flying seems trivial at this point in time of the climate crisis, when not much has been done to effectively address the bigger problems. Personally, it gets on my nerves a little bit when Ken addresses environmental issues in this way, saying that flying is the worst thing you can do. This seems more like his own assessment of flying, not a general truth, and definitely not a maxim that I am inclined to accept with everything else we have learned in this class.

Before this video I always knew flying was terrible for the environment, as an international student from Switzerland I fly many times a year to see my family and friends. Apart from moving back, there is not much I can do to limit my travel time. However, I try to offset this in other areas of my carbon footprint, such as not owning a car and riding a bike instead. Also by adjusting my diet towards a vegetarian diet. In terms of solutions, I believe the only way to fly should be commercially, private jets should not be widely used as they are today. Just because someone has the means to buy more and fly more doesn’t mean they should. We all need to do our part to accommodate our transportation methods as best we can to minimize our carbon footprint.

I was surprised to find out how bad air travel is for the environment. However, once watching Kens lecture it is more obvious why. What made it all make sense was learning that 80% of all flight is made by 1% of the population. Reflecting on this I was reminded of the fact that being part of the United States and even more specifically Santa Barbara we live in a bubble. I think it is very easy to forget just how small of a percentage the United States is in comparison to the rest of the world. As we learned earlier in this class, the United States makes 25% of all green house gasses. This might come off as extremist but I believe that the problem of climate change revolves around the United States. Our cultural practices have slowly been killing our planet. Prior to this lecture I never really considered how often I flied and the impact this had on our planet. However, I myself am guilty of flying to location still within California and I feel extremely guilty for it. 
 
<br><br>

This is probably one of my favorite lectures thus far because I feel like it really put into perspective for me how impactful our societies cultural practices are. Having read Packard’s 1960 study of consumerism I’m feeling discouraged that our society is going to be able to make the fundamental changes that are required to fix our planet. Plus all these cultural habits like flying and cars, I think it’s going to take a big shift in our mindsets to make the changes necessary. I think it’s easy to forget that for most of us here in the United Sates that we live a life of privilege and at the cost of our planet.

Now is most definitely the time to act. We need to reevaluate how often we use air travel. Ken gave a couple options about how we can stop flying so much. This included using new technologies for those that fly for business. For the recreational flyer he suggested that you take up the practice of slow travel and expand your trip to include the travel not just the destination. I thought this was a good idea and something that I personally am looking to do more off. However, I think this will be hard for the older generations like my parents.

I completely relate/agree to everything in this comment, but I completely relate to your first paragraph. To learn that 1% of the population is aboard 80% of all flights reminded me of the privilege that I have just from being born in the United States, let alone California. Flying is a normalized mode of transportation and I've never really considered both a. How rare it is to have air travel be an accessible and typical form of transportation from one place to another and b. How detrimental flying is to the environment. Ken's alternatives for flying, however, gave me some hope that our culture can change and that slow travel vacations can replace vacations that require air travel. We as a society need to act and see public transport/slow travel as a viable option because if we don't our planet will decline even faster than it is now.

I too, was surprised to hear how bad air travel is for the environment. I wouldn't say that air travel is a huge part of my life, I have only ridden round trip on an airplane twice and both times were within the United States; however, I had never even considered the impact those trips alone had on the environment. I really appreciate Ken for making this lecture and the one on automobiles because I feel like these are the two most difficult to change, yet would have the biggest impact. Also, in response to your comment about the United States being the #1 culprit behind climate change, I don't think you are being extremist at all. We have seen statistics about how the U.S. has emitted the most CO2 per capita, and this is primarily due to our consumerist cultural practices. Our entire way of life revolves around having more and better and quicker, but this has had extreme consequences on our planet. Now is definitely the time to act, we have no time left to waste. Now the challenge lies in whether our generation will do what the previous generations didn't do, which is drastically change our way of living. It is a huge challenge -- I am extremely uncertain in whether we will be able to do so, but the only hope lies in the power of our generation to influence public policies, advertisement, and consequently change our cultural practices as well. I don't think flying less will drastically change my life, but then again, it is the older generations that will have a harder time.
<br><hr>
I too was surprised to learn about how bad air travel is for the environment but the more that I think about it, the more that everything makes sense in terms of how bad any sort of transportation is for the environment. I think that we as a society, whenever we think of transportation as detrimental to our environment, we imagine cars and how much pollution is emitted through the use of/the production of cars. But airplanes generally don’t come to mind and sometimes I wonder why that is. Perhaps it is because, as Ken mentioned in the video, flying is seen as a privilege and not really a necessity whereas automobiles, especially in America, are looked at as essential. I agree that it is the U.S. that is the number one influence on why we are experiencing climate change and its because the world was influenced directly through America’s emissions of greenhouse gases and indirectly through America’s consumer mindset, which is slowly spreading around the rest of the world. As a person who’s flown from San Francisco to Palm Springs, it hurts to know that I am partly responsible for the extensive amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are due to air travel.

I really want to incorporate slow travel into my lifestyle, but I’m afraid that it won’t really be possible the moment I step foot off of UCSB’s campus. This is because, in order to get back home, I have to take a car ride and the moment I get back home, I’m going to have to drive or get driven everywhere I go just because of proximity. This may seem a bit contradicting, but I was accepted as a speaker at the Ecosummit and, in order to speak about my project (which is focused on trying to save freshwater in irrigation) I will have to take a flight to australia and back. This makes me feel really bad  but, at the same time, there really isn’t another way to represent my project at the ecosummit physically which is necessary since I will need to be able to have conversations with any potential sponsors/clients. I just wish that there was a way to get across oceans without polluting our planet.

There really is no substitute for seeing family and friends in person, so I don’t think Skype calls are a rational solution to the problem. I’m still a little confused as to how flying is the worst thing you can do for the environment. There are some wealthy people who fly a lot, like by private jet. There are others who travel by plane for work or vacations at least once a year. Most people, however, don’t fly at all. Something Ken didn’t address is whether driving across the country is worse than flying across the country. Is jet fuel that much worse than regular fuel?
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said about the older generations and United States being a root cause for climate change. I found it really interesting that just one activity performed by the 1% constitutes 2.5% of global greenhouse emissions. A lot of people have made comments about how that seems low but that's just one singular activity giving rise to a pretty impactful amount of CO2. I don't think air travel can be written off and I don't think it ever will. I do think it should be reevaluated though, flights should be decreased and perhaps more scientific research done on jet fuel efficiency (even though I have a feeling this already has been researched extensively). A lot of flights aren't necessary, especially ones pertaining to business where a simple Skype call could do the trick. It's also hard to inform people who are buying their tickets to not travel via plane because either they don't care about the green house emissions or they say "well the flight will happen with or without me". It's going to be tricky to minimize air travel but I think it is necessary and wouldn't be the biggest change to impact our current society (such as decreasing beef production would rattle our society).
<br><hr>
I don’t think it’s extremist at all to say that the climate crisis revolved around the United States. It’s hard to think outside the bubble we live in, even though it doesn’t feel like it we really are in the global 1%. Plenty of people outside the US will never fly anywhere, and I’m sure their happiness is not compromised at all. This lecture made me rethink my long list of places I’d like to travel, and if a fun trip is really worth the environmental impact. I liked how Ken proposed the idea of one grand trip rather than annual smaller ones. The cultural trend of taking a trip every summer or even every school break is really destructive and unnecessary, I almost feel embarrassed not going anywhere over summer. This video made me realize how little I actually gain from vacations, I already live in a tourist destination, I really don’t need to be flying to other ones all the time. As much as we need a cultural shift to address this issue, I hope that legal action can be taken as well, like a carbon tax that would make flying more expensive and less practical to do all the time.

I was not aware of how bad air travel actually is.  I travel with my family every summer to Mexico and we fly.  After watching this video it got me thinking of how much CO2 I have expended with the times I have flown.  It is completely astonishing to me, I could have never imagined that air travel would be literally the worse thing you can do.  The fact that 3 tons of CO2 is emitted if you were to fly from LA to Paris, and 6 tons of CO2 if you were to fly from LA to Paris but in first class.  This is so crazy to me, you literally are emitting tons of CO2 with just one single flight.  Not only that but people with private jets such as celebrities also causes a rapid harm, if not more than a normal flight.  By air traveling you are doing so much harm to the environment and are contributing to the climate crisis.  This doubles and even triples your carbon footprint.  Other countries are also starting to air travel much more frequently.  An example that was given was China is now traveling by airplane about 50% more.  Some possible alternatives to cut down on this and avoid airtravel would be to simply take the train.  The train is the most efficient way to travel.  By taking it you would be saving so much CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere.  I said every year I travel to Mexico with my family by airtravel, an alternative to this could be to take the train to San Diego, then a bus to the border.  After that board a bus that will take me to my destination in Mexico.  Doing this would save so much CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere.  It just is still so crazy to me how much CO2 is emitted with just a single flight to somewhere.  All these years I have traveled by the airplane and I have been releasing so much into the atmosphere.

I’ve only flown once, on a vacation trip to Cancun which I didn’t like and I’ll probably never fly again so this would be an issue for me if I’d had to quit flying. However I drive plenty as a student I’m sure I drive enough for 50 percent of my class. I drive to LA and back almost every weekend and sometimes 500 miles trips as well every other month. So I wouldn’t be doing the earth any better. I need to depend on other sorts of transport like buses or subways. It’d be hard to do because I like the freedom of going wherever I go but I could leave my car in school for long trips and only use it to go to the store and sorts.

I agree that flying isn't a good option for traveling and anyone who does not need a quick way to travel should seek other ways than going on a plane. Taking the train or bus is a good alternative that will cut back on the CO2 emissions that would have been released from flying. I would suggest trying to walk or take a bike to the store next Time.

Airplanes are a faster way of traveling which are often deemed convenient. You can get to Point B from Point A faster than if you drove, walked, or took a train. Ken’s lecture was interesting to me because it presented me with important information that I was not aware of. Almost everyone in my life relies on air travel at least twice a year, including myself. I did not know that only 1/20 people have and will use an airplane in their lifetime. I always assumed more people relied on air travel because it has always seemed like a frequent use of  transportation. In addition to that, while I knew that flying wasn’t environmentally friendly, I did not know that flying can double, even triples one’s carbon footprint. Ken’s point on how private jets have been glamorized is disappointing to hear, because when I was younger I remember believing it and wanting to get the chance to experience it. It’s disappointing to know that this will continue to happen as celebrities contribute to this concept because they “need” private jets in their lives. While flying is a problem, I know it can not be eliminated permanently. Many individuals do depend on it for career purposes. However, I do think it is a good time now to try to reduce airplane travel. One way I think can at least help reduce air travel is by informing the public about all the negatives that come with flying. If the public is presented with information of other ways of transportation like slow travel. Not all will choose to use slow travel, but some might consider it and use it. Another idea is possibly setting a restriction of how many times one can use air travel or having to pay a tax for it. This could help reduce time travel.

Flying from LAX to Paris would be 24 hours of flying. This 24 hours produces 3 tons of CO2 and flying first class is double that. This is astonishing to me. I don't fly much because I am from California but it saddens me that for my out of state friends that don't have a choice but to fly home they have contributed a large amount of CO2 to the atmosphere. I wonder if this will be something considered in the future when choosing a college. But, the reality that an occasional flight, like ones I would do, is still detrimental. Most of all though I want to state quite bluntly that we MUST stop idolizing celebrities that use private planes. The effect of this on the planet is selfish and disturbing. 
<br><br>

Another point that Ken made that I found interesting is that only 1% of the population makes up 80% of all flights. I find it ironic that our top 1% also produce a large part of the greenhouse gases in our environment. As every plane takes off from the Santa Barbara airport and soars over us in IV I will never be able to not imagine carbon emissions flowing from the plane and into our upper atmosphere. It might be a scary thought but it's a reality that we must face.

I am an international student who is from china. So i am really a frequent flyer. When there is a break between the quarters, i probably choose to go back to china as same as most of international students. We do this because during the break, residence hall will be closed. We don’t have other place to live in. So that could be one reason why we fly so frequently. As a result, if possible, i would like to fly less. If the residence hall can be open during the breaks.

“Some people will scoff, maybe even laugh at the idea of traveling in such a way”. Similar to last week’s lecture mass transportation or biking can have a negative connotation to it. The stigma behind bussing is only hindering the progress of an environmental healthy transportation system. It’s crazy to me that flying has become such a popular use of transportation yet there is no greener way of doing it. If one was allowed to only omit no more than 2 metric tons of CO2 per year, one flight would take out 2 years and even more for first class. As the population continues to increase, the amount of CO2 allocated to each person is going to decrease and people already don’t stay within their limit.  Flying is the fastest way to hurt the planet and makes up 2 ½ of the greenhouse gases emissions. As for a substitution for flying, I think telepresencing can be an easy adjustment. Facetime and Skype are already commonly used apps for conversation between tens, hundreds, and thousands of miles. You see in many movies that business meetings occur worldwide online. Our technology is advancing everyday, this transition should be one of the easiest. If flying for vacation reasons, I don’t expect much change to occur there. Ken mentions that a train ride, kicked back enjoying the view sounds like a perfect way to spend the day. The difference is time and speed. Cars can be just as comfortable, offering the same thing mass transportation has to offer, but faster. The speed is what is derailing the future of mass transport.

I completely agree with you. I don't think society would accept backtracking transportation; it will only get worse at this point. Yes, the idea of electric cars and other forms of transportation is appealing, but citing Ken's last video, there are too many cars that currently exist which produce carbon whether it's being used or stationary.

I agree with this comment and I think that there is a stigma behind bussing which is unfortunate considering that people should care more about the environment than what others think of them. I think that we should try and educate people on how bad flying is for the environment as its makes up 2 1/2 of the greenhouse gas emissions like you mentioned. If we want people to stay below the 2 metric tons of CO2 per year, then we have to tell people exacfly what will hurt or help their number and if I hadn't taken this class, I would have no idea the impact of flying on the environment. We definitely need to switch in person business meetings to telepresencing. It not only saves time and money for a company, it more importantly saves the environment. If the only reasons a business man or woman flies to a new state is for a discussion, then that could easily be done through a Facetime or Skype call. We as a society do almost everything with technology now and this needs to be the newest addition as well and if more people cared about the environment I'm sure it already would be happening. With our obsession with speed and instant gratification, it is hard to picture a society of people choosing a multi-day cross country train ride compared to a 5 hour flight but I believed it truly starts with educating people on climate change.

As Ken outline air planes all in all are extremely disastrous to our environment. Not only do planes require an immense amount of gas that is that in turn releases carbon dioxide directly into the second level of the atmosphere. Not only that but think these are massive automobiles that require an insane amount of parts. Therefore, the production alone into making them has to emit obscene amounts of or green house gases into the atmosphere as well. I mean its pretty obvious that a giant aircraft is not going to be environmentally friendly. Even though right now airplanes aren’t widely used like everything else it soon will be. Just as cars were first and American thing and part of mainly American culture they soon became part of our entire planets culture. Now, to imagine that occurring with air travel is beyond frightening. 
<br><br>

 In terms how we can substitute for airplanes in our lives I feel that Ken brought up some wonderful examples. I always wondered why companies required business trips for things like meetings or negations nowadays. We have the ability to simply video chat which I can guarantee is cheaper than a flight ticket and hotel rates. I think the answer to this problem is similar to the answer given last week, simplify.  I personally love to travel but I am very impatient so I pretty bummed that airplanes are environmentally disastrous, however what Ken described as slow travel despite my impatience sounds fun and definitely creates more memories.

Why the hell the government fail to build a super convenient high-speed rail network like in China? Because if so, we would travel much more readily on a train from places to places! Why the hell school refuses to provide free dorm in Spring Break! Because if so, we would not be crazy deciding where to go and maybe finally take an airplane to travel! 
<br><br>
There are just too many ways to contribute to the environment, but the Government did not choose to do it. Seriously, who will enjoy the trip on a plane? It is like confine you for 3 hours in a straitjacket like you are Hannibal that you can barely move. Also, you need to prepare extra time before flying and after landing, since the schedule is never on time. But taking a train is much freer, and you can spend a relaxing time with your friends, having a couple of teas, sharing cookies or more. If there is a better choice, we have already chosen to do it! So GOVERNMENT, DO IT!

Learning that 19 of 20 people on the planet have never set foot on a plane is completely outrageous to me, and exactly as Ken said in lecture I would never think of myself as apart of an elite class much less the 1% of any population. We spend our lives pointing the finger at the man and the small groups of people that hold so much wealth when on a global world-view we make up the small population that hoards vast amounts of wealth refusing to make a change and oppressing the less fortunate. It's easy to paint anyone else as the enemy and point at shortcomings like overpopulation and growing development when we were the ones who provided the mold for less developed nations to fit into. As I even mentioned in an earlier comment, other nations just want the same amenities and luxuries we enjoyed for decades, and as we are reeling from the initial effects of our decisions, we are condemning them for following the same path. There is no fighting fire with fire, if our house is on fire lets remove the flame, and extinguish what's plaguing our race and move forward into a life of change and lasting, sustainable kinship with our environment, each other, and our planet.

Traveling by plane was always something I thought people frequently did in the movies. I personally have only traveled by plane probably 5 times in my lifetime. I didn’t think it was a normal thing for people to do until I saw this video. But I realized I was not alone. It surprised me that 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never been on a plane before. The 1% are the ones who take advantage of this luxury. Most notably, the Kardashians always get offended when they are deemed spoiled rich people when they constantly post themselves on their private planes and how fun they are. What’s tricky for me to understand is how air travel is worse than car travel when air travel only accounts for 2.5% of green house gas emissions which is far less than cars. But as Ken explained air travel, it takes a really long time to travel by plane which means planes and jets use a lot of fuel. 
<br><br>

In accordance with the Paris Accords, we should only be emitting 2.5 metric tons of CO2 per person a year. Just like cars overshoot how much you’re supposed to emit, planes expend the amount of CO2 you’re supposed to emit for 1.5 years and if you travel first class it goes up to 3 years. Mind you, this doesn’t include the fact that people emit CO2 through other sorts of consumption. This makes me realize that we’re more in a crisis than I thought. Although it may seem pessimistic, it’s hard to imagine us as a society making the necessary choices to take action on these problems. The whole transportation issue and any other issue pressing the climate crisis dwindles down to the way we make choices as a society. For everyday Americans, car use and being wasteful is a norm. For the 1%, it’s their use of air travel. As a society all we need to do is be mindful of the choices we’re making. We know of better alternatives, we just the individual and political will to act on these changes for the betterment of our planet.

I was also surprised to learn that about 19 out of 20 people on the planet have never been on a plane. Moreover, I could not believe that 80% of all flights are made by 1% of people on the planet. This illustrates how flying can be seen as an example of an environmental justice issue. The wealthiest 5% of the human population are emitting copious amounts of carbon dioxide, mononitrogen oxides, and other greenhouse gasses, while others are forced to bear the repercussions. 
<br><br>


While watching this lecture, I frequently thought of the goals set by the Paris Accord. Just by going on one flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a person has already emitted more than their allotted metric tons of carbon dioxide for the entire year. I appreciated that you started that people emit carbon dioxide in many other facets of their life. Therefore, it is even more vital that we take steps to cut down sources that constitute large portions of our carbon footprint, such as planes or cars. I appreciated the solutions that Kens offered in the video, such as fly less, partake in the slow travel movement, and use telepresence (which can have a carbon footprint about 100 times smaller footprint than a face to face meeting). However, I believe that to truly limit air travel, airlines must make air travel less expensive. It should always be cheaper to take public transportation or drive than to take a flight.

I do not consider myself a frequent flyer since I live in California, I do not frequently have to fly for breaks. I understand that a less than 24-hour trip emits three tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and this is detrimental to our environment. However, I don't think people should feel guilty about flying because of its convenience and what a savior of time it is. I actually did scoff when Ken mentioned a six-day trip just to make it to the destination of San Francisco and back. I do agree that we should eliminate first-class because it doubles the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Unfortunately at this point in time, there is not really a great alternative to flying or at least nothing as efficient. Time is such an important thing and yes a person can slowly travel and discover new places they didn't know existed and get multiple Airbnb's; but, that may be more costly and some people just don't have the time. What if a person is extremely busy with work and life and has to travel for a business meeting? What if a person has to visit a dying family member? People shouldn't feel guilty for flying because there is just not a better alternative at this point in time. We can still focus on other effects that we cause that are more in our control as a largely plant-based diet, biking over suing cars, and public transportation to close distances.

-       I agree to some extent that it is ridiculous to expect someone to take much more time to travel in these times when the convenience of flying to destinations has become such a normal thing for a lot of people. We should try to be better about traveling in more renewable ways but some of the times it is just unrealistic and expensive. I like the way you mentioned that time is extremely important because that is indeed true. I understand that there is this competition between helping the climate change cause and doing things in a convenient way. But where is the argument for time coming in to play? Sure, we can eat a more plant-based diet and live in smaller houses but to what extent is someone really willing to spend many extra days traveling to get somewhere when they don’t have to. 
<br><br>
-       Going off of this idea I think it is important to stress that we should at least try to travel by plane less as much as we can, and I agree that eliminating first class flights would be a good step as well. More public transportation in a faster pace would also make it extremely easier for people to go places that are somewhat far away but not that far like San Francisco and Las Vegas.


<br><hr>

We should eliminate the first-class/private jets, and we should also limit how much we fly. However, I too agree that at this point in time, it is not realistic to completely cut out air travel, so we must reduce it by being conscious of our reason for flying. I also believe that people should not feel guilty about flying because there really isn’t a better alternative. Even the lectures on cars, I felt it was a little naive of Hiltner to simply recommend public transportation instead of cars when there are so many problems with public transportation regarding efficiency and dependency. I actually hate driving, and I would love for someone else to drive me. However, before learning to drive, I took the bus to different destinations (school, mall, etc), and my experiences were usually not pleasant ones. In my opinion, an important factor in discussing alternatives in response to global warming is addressing some disadvantages as well. Although Hiltner sees taking a six-day trip is magical, many will find it frustrating. As you mentioned, what if the reason for flying is an important one? However, I find the alternatives Hiltner mentioned small interesting ways that I would perhaps consider in certain conditions. I also agree that we can still focus on other things that are more in our control, and I like how your examples are realistic in today’s lifestyle.

<br><hr>
I prefer the points you mentioned in your comments (sorry Ken). Taking an airplane will indeed emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. From LA to Paris, it will put 3 tons of CO2 into the upper atmosphere directly, and double the emission if take the first class. However, many people usually have to take flights in their life. Take myself as an example, as an international student, it seems like that I need to take flights about 2-4 times a year. People might ask me questions like: “Why not take other transportation? Why not follow the slow travel movement?” I have to say that if there were better options I would have chosen them. To be honest, taking airplane for about 13 hours is not an enjoyable experience. Instead, it sucks. The space is limited and it is quite noisy. However, we need to admit that there is no better option for long-distance travel than taking an airplane so far. TIME matters, and I believe it is a common situation. Most people have limited time so that they need to reach their destination as soon as possible. It is no exaggeration to say that if I do have unlimited time and there is no pressure, I would never choose to fly.
<br><br>

However, the points I mentioned above should not be an excuse for anyone to take flights without consideration. We need to and have to try to reduce the time we fly. Moreover, some words in the lecture video might be a little bit discouraged. Even though you take flights sometimes, it is still significant to cut your footprint in daily life.

In the video “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally“, I was struck on a personal level because as environmentally conscious as I try to be, I ignored or didn’t fully realize the harm I do by flying.
<br><br>

My mother moved to the US from Europe leaving her close family very far away. Every other year we travel back to Europe to see my mother’s family because as effective as telepresence can be through modern technology, it is not the same as seeing the people you love face-to-face. After watching this video, I feel like a bad person for doing this so frequently, but in reality it’s not the act of going to see my family that is bad, but rather the ways we are doing it. I liked Ken’s idea of traveling less frequently, but for longer periods of time. This would be a very good solution for many families who are dealing with the same problems as our world seems to expand thanks to fossil fuels. Also, my mom was thinking about moving back to Europe so that she could be closer to her family and see them more frequently because flying is too costly to do frequently, but now, I think there is even more of a reason to go, aside from the cost. 
<br><br>

In many European countries, families are more centralized and less dispersed. New transportation and new mentalities around family life have changed that here in the US. 
<br><br>

As Ken said, I don’t think that this means that we have to stop traveling, but rather change the way we do it. I already have been a big fan of public transportation such as buses and trains from a young age, so I know that I would enjoy slow travel cross country, but it never seemed necessary to me as the “destination” was always more important than the distance traveled. Now, I want to start planning my trips to include my journey there and really implement slow travel into my lifestyle. Once slow travel becomes more of an idealized way to get around, it will also bolster mass transit and increase demand for better infrastructure.

Kens video about flying hits pretty close to home for me. My father is a building inspector for a third-party building company and he has to travel around the country a lot. He usually flies about 2 to 3 times a week just to go to his jobs and then at those jobs he has to travel by car to his different job sites there. While I know that he has a larger carbon footprint than most people, I do not know how he can do his job any other way. He can’t just inspect them through a camera from a long distance away because he has to look extremely carefully at buildings so that he knows that they are up to building standards. While he does try to take jobs that are closer to home so he does not have to fly, he is not able to get those kinds of jobs often. The thing I want to know is what do I say to him about it. He also can’t just quit his job because that is my family's primary source of income. He knows that traveling that much is not good for the environment, but I do not think there is any other way.

Ken explores how air traveling contributes to merely 2.5% of greenhouse gas, but is considered to be the worst environmental way of traveling. He addresses topics like jet sets and illustrates the carbon dioxide emission with the example of flying from LA to Paris. I was shocked when I learned that even one 24-hour flight per year has already went beyond the limit for each person’s carbon dioxide emission in a year according to the Paris Agreement. Whereas I’d like to argue that it’s inevitable for me, as an international student, to take planes from Asia to America for college education. There is no substitution at present while time is still quite valuable for me. I felt ashamed for the carbon footprints I have created but this seemed to be the only solution. 
<br><br>
Other tactics provided in the video seem more achievable, such as taking a train or telepresence. I must say that the development of transportation in China is pretty strong and rapid, in which it’s possible for us to travel from eastern part of China to the western regions within three days. There are also trains to other countries such as Russia. I was also fascinated by the notion of slow fashion and slow movement brought out by Ken. His quote that “Life is really about journey, not destination” really inspired me and it’s highly recommended to value and enjoy the process we have gone through. These moments mark the preciousness and uniqueness of our lives.

One of the things Ken said in this video that struck me the most was that 95% of the population had never been on a plane in their lifetime. The fact that planes have such an awful impact on the environment and only 5% of the world’s population have ever flown further solidifies the idea that the wealthy and privileged are doing much, much more to hurt our planet than anyone in any under-developed country. Some people (usually white and of higher status) choose to argue that they don’t need to do anything to help the environment and that it’s people in countries like India that are killing our planet by having so many darn kids! I have some very choice words for these people (some that I will not mention here because they are quite vulgar). First off, this ideology is straight up racist and no one can deny that, and secondly, how the hell can you not recognize that people like you are the worst when it comes to being eco-friendly? Are you seriously so blinded by your privilege that you can’t admit that travelling in a huge hunk of metal thousands of feet in the air is probably not very good for the environment?
<br><br>
I understand the appeal of travel, I really do. I myself hope to explore more of our world in the future. However, as Ken stated, flying is not the only way to travel. There are so many ways to get out and explore the world without getting on a plane and I think that a shift in travel culture is necessary to decrease the number of people who get on a plane annually. 
<br><br>
One part of the video that really resonated with me was when Ken said that travelling is not only about the destination, but the journey as well. I personally would rather take a train and get to look at all of the views along the way (in a much roomier and more comfortable seat I may add) than let the journey get completely lost as I sit cramped and uncomfortable at 31,000 feet. As Miley Cyrus once said, “Life’s a climb, but the view is great”.

The two statistics are so hard to believe: flying only accounts for 2.5% of the carbon footprint, and 80% of the flights are made only by the 1% of all people. I always feel like taking a plane as the transportation is a very common practice. More people are traveling, and more people are becoming economically able to afford light tickets, especially in China, just like Ken mentioned in the video that the number of Chinese people taking the plane has risen 50% in the past decade. My assumption turns out to be very wrong, apparently, and it also made me realized what a bubble I live in and reminded me that there are billions of people not only can’t afford to take a plane but are suffering from poverty. 

<br><br>


Hearing that taking a plane is much worse than a car makes me upset because I live in China, and simply going home and back to the campus require 2 to 3 round trips, each last for about 12 hours. That is a lot of air traveling, and it’s not even recreational to me because I’m technically not traveling for fun but just going back home and visiting my parents after three or four months away from home. Hearing Ken introducing alternatives is even worse, because none of his suggestions sound realistic to me, or to anyone who is an international student. We only have three times a year to go back home, while Ken is suggesting to cut the number of vacations. Slow traveling might sound appealing for short-distance trips, but what about those across the Pacific Ocean? Although flying is very detrimental to the environment in terms of the huge amount of carbon dioxide released through one single flight, but I personally think it will be nearly impossible to persuade people to switch to other public transportations for traveling. The major reason is because air traveling is the fastest way available for all human beings. I think even more people will start to prefer air traveling in the future, until the next innovation on public transportation comes out, and I sincerely hope that technology will create a way for us to travel quickly and more environmentally friendly.

The problem with slow travel is that it would cut vacations down drastically. Many Americans already have only a short period of time allotted for vacationing a year, if they get any. Thus, when Americans take their vacation days, they want to be at their destination as fast as possible, in order to ensure they spend as much time as they can there. While they may have an enjoyable time taking a train from Santa Barbara to Florida before flying to the Caribbean, I am positive that they would rather have spent all their time in the Caribbean, instead of wasting the 2+ days riding a train.
<br><br>


In order to move people to slow travel, there would have to be a huge shift in the way a typical year of work is set up and allow people to have time to waste during their vacation. However, even if we had this, the wealthiest people, if not everyone, would still fly to their destination to get the extra bit of time at their destination. Perhaps a way to incentivize slow travel is by allotting extra vacation days for people who choose to travel by train or bus and get it verified with their employers, yet there is a huge potential for abuse of this incentive and many arguments to be made against it.
<br><br>


I agree that the time for frequent flying should be coming to an end. I don't see the airline industry going out of business anytime soon though. I think an important way for frequent flying to end is by utilizing telepresence as you've said, as I am sure that some people who frequently fly for their jobs do not always need to be there in person, and with advancements in technology, I am sure that soon they could perform their job proficiently without being there.

<br><br>

The problem with telepresence as a whole is that for family and friends, it will never replace a face to face meeting, and that is pretty well agreed upon. These face to face experiences mean so much to people too, that I see people overlooking the fact that telepresence is a fraction of the carbon footprint. What should be marketed to these people is trains, not phones, so that the face to face meeting occurs, yet with a smaller carbon footprint than flying.

I actually found it quite interesting that flying is one of the worst things you can do environmentally. I had always figured that 1.) it’s a form of public transportation, 2.) that flights weren’t frequent/often enough to cause or exceed the amount of the pollution that automobiles can produce, and that 3.) such a small portion of the population actually exercise use of airfare that it, again, can’t compare to the frequency and amount in which we utilize personal auto vehicles. Ken says that, though it is true that only a miniscule portion of the population use airfare, and will ever use airfare, and that flying only produces around 2% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, one flight from LA to Paris would cause nearly 3 tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. One flight increases your general climate impact by nearly 2-3x what it would normally be. I really am completely shocked and bewildered by just the magnitude of how bad it is, even though it makes up a generally small amount of the greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br><br>

Ken brings up the valuable point that just because it only constitutes 2% of the total emissions doesn’t mean that isn't extremely harmful. Flying is one of the most detrimental personal choices we can make environmentally, and we have to be able to understand the reality of its severity. You shouldn’t be flying as your primary means of travelling if you can feasibly avoid it. Flying is something people don’t really consider as being a huge climate impact because the average person hardly ever flies, or won’t ever fly in the duration of their life. This makes it hard for the average person to face the consequences that flying causes, and it’s the lack of awareness to the reality of flying that makes it even more damaging environmentally.

While I don't believe that it's possible to completely eradicate air travel at this time, I think that significantly cutting down on how much we fly is something that can and must happen quickly. I think that splitting means of transportation between mass transit such as buses or trains and planes is such an easy way to cut down one's carbon footprint while traveling that there's really very little reason not to do it. Along with this, after watching this video, I see very little appeal to flying first class as the fact that it doubles your emissions is absolutely insane. As I live out of state, since coming to UCSB I have become a bit of a frequent flyer as I fly home every time I go home during break, and after this video, I feel very guilty about this. Since I don't have a car here, I have often felt as though air travel is my only option in terms of getting back home, however, after watching this video I do feel as though I can try to reduce my carbon footprint while traveling. Since I live in Oregon, I'm guessing there is some form of mass transit I could take to get home, and though it would take far longer than an hour and a half flight, it's definitely worth it if it means severely cutting down my emissions. I really appreciate the fact that rather than solely focusing on the negative effects of air travel on the environment, Ken has presented some pretty accessible solutions that nearly everyone can take part in. I think that if we start with cutting back on how often we use planes as transportation, mass transit systems will only grow and become even more accessible for the public, which could hopefully one day lead to air travel becoming extremely unpopular,  or even ceasing to exist in the future.

After watching this video, I felt absolutely guilty. Not only because I took several flights each year, but also because I realize it is just impossible and unrealistic for me to reduce my flying times. As Ken mentioned in this video, if I’m considering traveling from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, I should definitely take the train instead of the flight because it is much more environmentally friendly in terms of minimizing my carbon footprint. However, what about another crucial factor, the opportunity cost? Of course, all of us can try to minimize our number of times taking the flight on personal/entertainment purpose trips, but this suggestion failed to consider the times when we have to take the flight because of its convenience. Take, myself, for example, each year I take an average of five times flying between Beijing, China and Los Angeles, California for academic purposes (since I attend university outside of my native country). If I chose other methods of transportation instead of flying, I would possibly be able to arrive in Santa Barbara when the quarter ends. I am well aware that this might draw the argument like “we can avoid flying on other kinds of trips.” Yes, but still, the opportunity cost. Imagine taking a trip from Santa Barbara to Miami, if I have lots of spare time, I could take the train, enjoying my time, and stop on the way to visit other places. But if this is going to happen during this year’s spring break, I definitely wouldn’t risk the ten-day-holiday by spending half of the time on transportation. I am not denying the fact that flying brings a very harmful impact on the environment, but the invention of the plane indeed aims to reduce the time and inconvenience of traveling, that’s why you and I are taking the plane. Each unique circumstance will hold people considerate of their choices. Overall, I think it is highly unrealistic for people to give up taking the flight unless another equivalent transportation method is introduced which is more environmentally friendly.

This lecture video highlights the importance of not flying to our climate. Personally, I fly once or twice a year but even that is too much. A solution to this would be by using transports such as by train. This solution though is not very comfortable and or efficient; oftentimes our breaks are not long enough to spend 2-3 days traveling one way. Until our trains become more advanced I will not be using this form of travel when being compared to a flight.

<p>
I wish that I could get on board with not flying. I am a frequent flyer and have grown up flying several thousand miles a year. I’m more comfortable in a plane than in a train. And I know that that’s not really an excuse. More than that, my life is completely spread over the globe with friends spanning from Africa to Canada to East Asia to Europe and as much as I would love to visit my Canadian girlfriend and the friends I have around the world by train and boat, the school schedule we have doesn’t allow for slow travel. I more than intend to use slow travel as a way of getting around to vacations in Europe or elsewhere because I agree that it does have a higher value. I think those would be ideal. I also find it hard to see why we say that a round trip will put in more carbon into the air than driving a truck. Per person, there are more than 150 people that can fit (and often do) in a plane whereas a truck can carry 5. How is the flying mass transit the worst thing we can do? How does the math work out?

After watching the lecture video, "Flying, the absolute worst thing you can do environmentally". I find the lecture video informative and as usual, alarming. I found it crazy that flying even once in your life would drastically contribute 2-3 tons of carbon emission to the environment, and if you have the monetary means to fly first class, you contribute twice the amount, thus, 6 tons of co2 emission to the environment. As someone who had quite a lot of travelling experience, I was not expecting for flying to be that impactful to the environment. At first, I thought that flying would not really impact and is considered safe and convenient, like subways and buses, but after watching this lecture video, I never felt so wrong. It seems like travelling through air is the worst thing you could do to the environment because you are directly omitting co2 emission. In addition, I discovered that it wouldn't matter if you switch your diet to plant-based foods, switching your consumer expense, and etc. If you fly, you are putting everything that you put in to save the environment in jeopardy. Overall, I feel like adjusting and finding an alternative way of flying will be difficult to our society, just because we recently adapt this transportation system, in which airline tickets are getting more affordable and accessible to people.

After watching this lecture and frankly all of the recent lectures, I am shocked at how much of a negative impact methods of transportation have on our environment. I always knew that flying was bad for the environment, but not to this extent. Flying is the worst way of traveling. While it is essentially unavoidable for certain groups to not use airplanes, everyone should be aware of the impacts. The fact that 19 out of 20 people in the world have never set foot on an airplane and yet flying accounts for two percent of GHG emissions is absurd. While some places can only be reached by airplane, we as a society should try to switch to more green ways of transporting as 1 gallon of gas can take a person 350 miles incomparable to any car or plane. I agree with your comment that finding alternative modes of transportation will be difficult in our society, but at this point it has become necessary. In the end we will have to compromise for the safety of our environment.

The problematic usage of airplanes is yet another thing that is mainly contributed by American society. It is especially annoying that, once again, a major part of our problems are being contributed by the wealthy, when it is completely unnecessary. The glamorization of fast air travel, such as  private jets, is pretty terrible, and it makes me sad that a lot of people look up to these rich people as role models. It is upsetting that airplane usage contributes so much to carbon emissions, because it is something that is seen as completely normal in American culture.

<br><br>

I'm glad that I am able to acknowledge these things now because of this class, but at the same time, the solutions seem much more difficult to adjust to. For example, what if there is a scenario in which a person must travel around the world multiple times within the span of weeks, such as if they are famous artist, or a speaker? It would be draining to that person's health to take the train constantly, even worse so than the jetlag they get from their plane. I suppose the solution to this problem would be to fly coach, rather than on a private jet, but it still sucks because they are still contributing a large part to carbon emissions. As technology improves, our planet always seems to suffer as a consequence.

I feel that people don't really consider how much their carbon footprint is increasing when flying because they're most likely filled with excitement to get to their destination whether that'd be to see a relative or visiting a new place. I was surprised to learn that only one percent of the world population uses airplanes for transportation, I thought more of us would have been using it due to how crazy airports are. People who fly for transportation don't really consider themselves a part of the "Jet Set" because to them that's the rich and famous which doesn't include most middle class families, however to poorer areas they are considered a part of it. I don't think this form of transportation will go away anytime soon because of how much profits it's making and it's especially not going anywhere for the rich and famous because they only want the best of the best for themselves and they don't care for others as much as we do for them unless they have a camera on them. I feel that if slow travel was cheaper, if teachers taught their students about this dilemma and if the WiFi actually worked on it, then more people would use this as a means for transportation. The problem with this is that people have become lazy and overweight and want things to come quick to them because waiting is unbearable. I kind of like the idea of biking to my destination and taking breaks to sleep in an AirBnB. I feel that would be a good way to let off some steam and get a long with your friends or family.

I'm not someone who has traveled a lot by plane like a lot of the population. There are many who infrequently fly or randomly over the years, so I see this as an issue where it is mainly due to the wealthy class, who may fly weekly or monthly. There are also plenty of corporations that require employees to travel to conferences and whatnot, so I feel like there are some who wouldn't mind or would love to lessen their carbon footprint, but their need to do their jobs exceeds that. Although I feel like this would be a small feat to overcome as there are actually so many who don't fly on planes but also doesn't feel so small because since there are not so many people who do fly you see how a small part of the global population contributes to the greenhouse gas effect. I am very much interested in traveling the world though, so it's hard to accept that I shouldn't do so and creates a conflict for me. My parents have even been trying to go out more and see the world because they want to experience the beauties of what's around us. Honestly, this whole flying thing makes for an interesting conversation that makes one consider their lives.

I agree with what Ken points out in the video, but I think flying is necessary for our life, especially for us, the international students. We, international students, came from other countries, like Korea, Japan, England, Hong Kong. Those cities are far away from the United States. And we only have a limited time to go back home at the winter break, so flying is our only way to go home. We can't speed half of the break only on transportation. But, I also know that flying is really a problem for our climate. It is a climate disaster. So we have to reduce the replaceable flying time. For example, we can reduce the short flight. Like, we stop use air-plane for a trip which is less than four hours. Those trips are replaceable. Since the time we spend at the airport and flying is almost the same as using the train. China does great in this area. A flight from Shenzhen to Wuhan is around two and a half hours. The high-speed train from Shenzhen to Wuhan is only four hours. Don't forget we have to go to the airport two hours before the flight take off. So the high-speed train is even faster than flying. Right now, in China, more and more people choose to use high-speed trains for traveling instead of flying. I think the reason why American chooses not to use the train is because of the time. If the government build a high-speed train, which makes the travel between train and flying become the same, I believe more people will choose to use the train than flight.

I feel ignorant and privileged for not even thinking about the environmental consequences of flying. I had no idea that so many people have never even set foot on an airplane. I thought it was something very common. 
<br><br>
I would love to travel to more places across the world, but I'm not sure how to do that without flying. I mean I could take the train and then fly from there, but that would still be so much CO2 released into the atmosphere. I need to start finding alternatives for ways to travel. I guess I could fly to Europe and then explore by hiking and biking. 
<br><br>
I also can't believe that I could have a plant-based diet, have a tiny house, waste no food, and take public transport but can still exceed my carbon limit by taking one flight. People need to be more educated about flying. I had no idea of the consequences and I'm sure many others don't know about them either. They need to learn that taking the train would be a way more enjoyable experience. Instead of being cramped for hours on a plane in a tiny seat, they could have more legroom and an even better view.

I am by no means a frequent flyer and have done little traveling yet, but it is one of my biggest dreams to do so someday soon. It is mindblowing and crazy to think of all the underlying consequences that make up flying, wasting all our yearly carbon footprint allowance. It makes it seem almost impossible to ever consider flying. I don’t know how and where I stand with this particular lecture, and it seems I am not alone. Those that travel far for schooling, must go home. It seems cruel to say that they should consider going back less, and just choose mobile ways of contact. I truly am not sure I stand by the side of this lecture. Slow travel sounds quite far from ideal and I don’t think most of us have the time to do so...I feel quite conflicted about this. I don’t want to harm the planet, but at the same time, the suggestions you propose in terms of taking a 6 day bike trip...it just doesn’t seem like it could apply to everyone, realistically. On the other hand, I can definitely get on board with slow food, taking time to prep meals using local food. The other suggestion that really made me squint, and think, “Really?” was the one about taking a train all the way to New York, then take a plane to Europe. If we had enough time for this all year, I’m sure it would be more possible, but it just doesn’t seem to be plausible, due to schedule and...I don’t know. I see the environmental problems, however, I don’t see this as the solution that will save it all. I make my own personal contributions to this already by choosing not to take the plane when going home- I take carpool/rideshare, the bus, or train, to the Bay Area. I know quite a few friends that actually choose the plane (out of convenience and speed), but the prices are crazy, and I never did think it was necessary. Perhaps, in a way, that is my way of following “slow travel,” but my no means do I see my choice as drastic as spending days on the road to get to my destination- I just delay my arrival by half a day.



</p><hr>



<p>
I believe that as easy as it is for me to say not flying a plane is doable, I think of all my family that wouldn't be able to go back home given the longevity of the trip. Many people wouldn't be able to make this change because they've already adapted to luxury of traveling to other worlds and get work done or just visit their families. The reason is that, apart from time, sometimes train tickets cost more money than taking a plane ride straight to the destination, especially when it’s a trip from California to Europe. This doesn’t allow lower income families to easily choose taking the more environmentally friendly route as opposed to a cheap airplane ticket to their destination. I guess this is mainly an American issue given that many citizens and cultures of the U.S are from numerous different countries around the world, therefore, aside from luxury travel, traveling to visit ones family would be tremendously difficult. You’d practically be saying that the most efficient way of avoiding carbon emissions from planes is to stay where you are or where you came from because a days-long boatride or hike isn't ideal.

It is extremely striking to hear that it is only the 1% who use airplanes the most. I am getting really tired of seeing how much damage wealthy people do. These people have millions, billions of dollars they can help the world with, while still remaining wealthy people. People like Jeff Bezos could be doing so much but greed is a real thing. 
<br><br>


It is very saddening to hear how bad airplanes are knowing how they allow us to travel places in such short times. That is all it does though, shorten the time to get there. Ken is right; there are other alternatives friendlier to the environment and that even costs less. It just sucks that today we want to get from point A to point B quickly because of the fast pace we live in. I never thought of airplanes being so toxic to the planet because they aren't like cars that you see every day but it makes complete sense. I really don't think it is possible to stop or even lessen the usage of airplanes because of that 1% abroad these planes. Rich people do whatever they want because they can. 19 out of 20 is a WILD statistic. I simply am baffled.

As Ken mentioned flying is a luxury and only ten percent of the worldwide population has ever stepped foot on a plane. This privilege of traveling from one location to another at a relatively fast speed has great environmental consequences. The greatest negative impact is the probability of doubling or tripling our individual climate footprint. 
<br><br>
I find it funny how a lot of people in the comments recognize their air travel choices are a problem for the environment but refuse to give up that lifestyle. This is definitely a class issue, the reason the majority of people in the world do not travel is because they don't have the finances to do so. This goes back to the the issue that those in power contribute the most to the climate crisis but refuse to change their actions in regards to the problem. Evidently, the worst thing one can do is air travel; although, it only accounts for  two percent of the climate crisis, it is something to take personally as it looks into our own actions. Choosing to fly and consciously emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is a choice and no corporation or outside factor is to blame on this one.



<br><hr>

I also think Ken is completely right. Actually, there are many other methods that we can use to get to another destination, such as: sharing bus, high- speed trains. Although they will take us more time for transportation, their effect to climate is less. However, in current society, people always pursue efficiency instead of protecting environment, but we must pay attention to the increase rate of carbon dioxide level. We have learned that we have been in middle of the sixth extinction, and this is a really serious situation. What we can do to change this situation from the side of transportation is taking less flights.

Flying is one of the most common ways to travel, because people can save lots of time by taking planes. But there are many different ways to reduce the carbon dioxide emission, like bikes, subways, buses. According to the Paris Accord, everyone just can emit one or two tons of carbon dioxide per year. But it people take a plane, they will exceed the limit of carbon dioxide emission. So people can try to take buses or trains to travel. Because trains can carry one person 800 miles by only one gallon. Ken also suggests us to ride a electronic bicycle which will create carbon dioxide.

“80% of all flights are made just by 1% of the people on the planet”. What?! I had to rewind this three times just to make sure I heard Ken correctly. As this course goes on, I’m noticing how the wealthiest people are the least conscious ones when it comes to helping the environment. I definitely agree with Ken, if there’s no reason for you to fly then don’t fly. I understand that sometimes people want to take well-deserved vacations or just visit friends and family, however doing this multiple times a year is just hurting the environment, even though you think your choice alone doesn’t contribute to pollution. It is crazy how we thought the future was going to hold flying cars and now after watching this lecture, I’m glad this isn’t going to happen anytime soon. If airplanes alone contribute so much to our carbon-footprint in the air, flying cars would just end it all for all of us. Personally, I think there should be an extra tax for the wealthy people who fly the most. They’re contributing twice and/or even triple the amount of CO2 into the atmosphere while being comfortable in a first class seat contrast with those who fly normally. It’s like the wealthy are getting rewarded for doing the absolute worst. We should definitely stick to using the train, biking, and walking when a destination is reasonably close and only use airplanes when it’s an emergency.

I agree with your statement that the wealthiest people are the least conscious environmentally and socially. When I see celebrities on social media such as Kim Kardashian tweeting "climate change is real" with a broken heart emoji and then proceed to show off a tour of her private 747 jet and her other family member post they're private jet trip just to pick someone up for dinner. It really shows out of touch wealthy people are with reality. It is also frustrating that only 1% of the population contributes to 80% of all flights on the planet, that such a minority of people can contribute that much much to the climate crisis. 
<br><br>
    I have never been on a plane in my life and being a frequent or even occasional flyer is something that ever even comes up once in thought or conversation with my family. It is wild to me to imagine that there are people who see flying as a convenience and as something they regard so casually-and carelessly. My first year here at UCSB I had always taken the train to go back home and have very interesting memories of my trip, much more comfortable than my cramped ride shares.  I can only imagine how much more fun a train ride would be when riding with your friends and family, something I plan on utilizing in the summer to travel up and down the coast. Flying, like owning cars, has become culturally considered cool. It's disappointing how something so environmentally disastrous can be considered cool.  Just like with cars, we need a cultural shift to make flying not-appealing and "uncool," and point our attention to more eco-friendly alternatives such as trains.

I totally agree with your comment. I see a lot of people in the comments getting mad at this lecture video as they see it as Ken telling them they can never go on a plane again if they really care about the environment. A person who occasionally goes on a plane for vacation or visiting family is not the main issue here. The real problem is the people who are on planes multiple times a month, or even a few times a week. These people are the wealthy that can afford to fly whenever they want. For example, rich celebrities who fly around in their private jets to go on unnecessary vacations or to travel quickly when they could have instead driven or taken another means of transportation. The reason they fly is that it is more convenient. When money isn’t an issue, most people would choose a flight over a train ride or driving because flying is exponentially faster. We need to focus on these people when we are talking about flights causing damage to our planet, not the people that maybe fly once a year.  So while it is a better choice for the environment for an individual to take a different form of transportation, if someone wants to take that trip of a lifetime to Europe or somewhere, they should do it. You just have to take a look at your privilege. As the lecture points out, 19 out of 20 people have never been on a plane. What should be taken away from this lecture is that if you are able to not take a plane, you should. But if it is necessary to fly, you should do it, but just remember how it is impacting the planet.

Learning about how traveling via an airplane is the single most harmful thing you could do for the environment really made me think about alternative modes of long-distance transportation. In the lecture, professor Ken talks about telepresencing and slow traveling as being an alternative to flying, however, there are major tradeoffs and inconveniences that come with trying to travel eco-friendlier. For example, traveling through telepresencing will not always be the same as being there physically in person. One may not be able to be present solely online and may require them to travel in person. In regard to slow traveling, people may not always have the time to implement such a method of traveling. For example, in the comments, many people are talking about how slow travel simply does not work with their schedule and may actually be more expensive than traveling by plane. Now, people are conflicted on whether or not they should fly for the sake of being environmentally friendly, or for the sake of money and convenience. 
<br><br>

Admittedly, the solutions for air travel seem a little too radical and unusual for the current society. Although I am all for being more conscious about how much carbon we put into the air, there just are not enough alternatives available. Many people will not be willing to use the method of slow traveling when they could cut their travel time from a few days to a few hours using a plane. With the fast-paced society that Americans have grown accustomed to, I am not too sure that there is much hope in changing the number of flights that take place. However, I do think that when it comes to a smaller scale, there are better ways other than flying. For example, when traveling in California, there should be no reason to use an airplane when the train and carpooling exists. 
<br><br>

Considering that air travel has only been utilized by 5% of the world population but has contributed around 2% of the total carbon emission rate is an astonishing statistic. There needs to be a more sustainable alternative to flying before it becomes too much of the norm and a commodity to others. Rich people should not be able to own private jets and airplanes for these reasons. This is a major problem that I feel can be easily discouraged by prohibiting the use of such personal transportation. Although we have yet to figure out a solution, the ones that Ken suggested in his lecture are a great place to start if possible.

I really support a lot of the points you've made. While I like telepresencing to an extent and think it's better than just a phone call or texting since it's more personal, sometimes there are sensitive topics best discussed in person, but unfortunately, if you're thousands of miles apart from each other, telepresencing is the more convenient option, albeit not the best one. You really can't replace the body language and expressions that people make throughout a conversation with a screen that only shows their faces; at that point, there's always something each person isn't seeing. I like the idea of slow traveling because it places better emphasis on the journey itself rather than simply the destination as Ken pointed out, but as you mentioned,  there's no getting around the fact that we all lead busy lives and when we do get breaks, a lot of people prefer spending as much time at their chosen destination as possible rather than also having to allocate extra days to account for getting there. Also, I really don't have much faith in the metro and long-distance train systems in America, since it pales in comparison to other countries that emphasize public transit much more and have built proper infrastructure around that idea; the U.S. is defined by cars, and massive amounts of infrastructure designed specifically for automobiles, not trains. I'm not really sure what can be done to improve our nationwide train infrastructure, but until there are meaningful improvements to trains in America, I just can't justify taking a train over a plane to somewhere like New York. Some destinations are too far away. In the end, I hope that we can implement eco-friendly enhancements to important modes of transportation like planes and trains so that we can get from Point A to Point B fairly quickly while still respecting our planet. I would love to see plans for a cross-country bullet train soon.

Although I can agree with the fact that flying is terrible for the environment, flying allows people to go on business trips, visit family, or relax in a different part of the world. I think instead of attacking the general population, we should focus on billionaires and celebrities who use private jets on the daily. Sure, flying is bad for our planet, but there are bigger issues we should be worrying about. That plane is still going to fly no matter if we decide to go on it or not. That plane is still going to produce tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere no matter if we are on it or not. The only solution is if everybody in the world collectively agreed to stop flying but that is pretty silly and impossible. 
<br><br>

So is Hiltner suggesting to us that if  we want to be environmentally conscious, we should stop flying all together? What about people who have family members in other parts of the world? Should I “slow travel” to China to see my relatives? That’s just not very realistic. There are a lot of people who fly from city to city for work, how are these people expected to travel quickly without the use of a plane. How are people expected to consolidate as much as possible when we live such fast paced lives today? Our schedules don’t allow us to plan out vacations and such so graciously. “Slow travel” only works if you are planning to go somewhere nearby, not overseas. I don’t think it’s very realistic to expect people to write air travel out of their lives. What we can do is focus on making the mass transit system more effective and more attractive. Or a more realistic solution is to improve air travel itself, by reengineering planes to be more environmentally friendly.

My family doesn’t have enough money to fly and visit our family abroad. However, I’ve loved all the times that I have been able to fly in an airplane. I knew it had to be bad for the environment to some extent, but I had no idea how bad flying truly was for our planet. Air travel is a major contributor to climate change. Even if a person says they don’t travel all that much, the 2.5% of greenhouse gases emitted still add up. It’s important to lean towards methods of public transportation such as carpooling, trains, subways, and buses! The United States is an extremely developed country, so people don’t think about the consequences of transportation. It makes me sick, so I make sure to walk, ride my bike, take the bus, and carpool whenever possible.

Professor Ken makes a lot of good points in this lecture, and I agree with him that planes are not great for our environment. But, it’s hard for me to imagine a life without planes. What would be the alternative? And, is the alternative cheaper than flying on a plane? Many people use planes for work, not because they actually want to. So, I wonder how a lot of people’s careers would be affected if planes were completely eliminated… would corporations become less successful because they don’t have people travelling for them? I’m also a bit skeptical about choosing to ride a train, or even bike, instead of flying so that there is less carbon in the atmosphere. Even if Ken decides to bike to San Francisco to better the environment, that plane that he could have taken is still going to take off and emit CO2 in the atmosphere whether Ken and his family are on that plane or not. Either way, planes are harming the planet so I feel like just choosing not to fly as an individual won’t really help. The only way for us to cut down on how much we use planes is to make it a law and put a cap on how much we can fly annually. I think we still really need planes, and they are very important and necessary, but we also don’t need them as much as we are actually using them. Maybe flying short distances, like from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, shouldn’t be allowed because there are obviously other ways that are just as easy as flying. However, flying out of state or out of country could be allowed because it is farther away, hence more difficult to find a better way of transportation. This is just an idea, but I do believe the only way of cutting down plane use is to make it it’s own law.

I agree, I was intrigued by the points Ken made, such as cutting down vacations. What appealed to me is when he brought up "slow travel" and how a trip to San Francisco can be taken by electric bikes and stopping at airbnbs. Personally, I love the thought of that, as it sounds like an adventure and less about the destination. However, it's difficult for me too to imagine a world completely without planes because it provides so much for some people, like for international or out of state students to attend UCSB. Slow travel would take far too long for people on a fast quarter system with short breaks. And just like you said, the plane is still going to take off even if Ken isn't on board. Unless it's a large movement where people stop flying altogether, I don't see it happening. I hate sounding pessimistic because I want to believe things will change, but I still can't get over how many rely on planes as a necessity. I like the idea of outlawing short flights from relatively short distances like LA to San Francisco when there's the train as an option. The people who constantly fly for work or for conferences, assuming they have a good income to go to all of these places, should pay a carbon tax to offset their huge footprint.

I also see how Ken's lecture on the environmental problem with planes can be a bit difficult to deal with and controversial.  However, I think spreading the recognition of the carbon footprint behind flying can do a lot for the environment in the long run.  Once new more renewable technologies emerge for air travel, perhaps the government can regulate what technologies airports use so that airports are more carbon efficient.  The alternatives to plane travel may not seem that great either, but the awareness behind the carbon footprint of planes can be a factor in deciding where families want to go for vacation.  A drive to Lake Tahoe would be more sustainable than a plane trip to Hawaii, for example. Ken's example of a desirable vacation and travel method was biking along the California coast.  I can see how this is probably not appealing to most people especially when considering the hills and the pain after biking all day, but another perhaps more appealing alternative may be a boat trip along the California coast.

The lecture was incredibly informative – I know beforehand that planes were bad for the environment, but I don’t think I truly understood how bad until I watched the video. It’s also really interesting that only 19 out of 20 people have been on a plane, or the equivalent. Flying seems like a really prominent part of our lives, living in the United States, but it’s not like that for the rest of the world. But it’s also a really important part, which is why, as you point out, it makes it hard to imagine the alternatives. People like getting to places as fast as they possibly can, because the human race as a whole is incredibly impatient. Planes will still continue to exist as long as capitalism itself exists, because the industry as a whole is a multi-billion dollar industry. As you point out, one way to limit is through laws, but I seriously doubt that any laws proposed limiting the use of planes will pass easily.
<br><hr>
I agree with your points about picking and choosing when to fly and when to use slow travel.  I understand that flying is one of the worst things that you can do for your carbon footprint, but I am a firm believer that in this day in age, especially in America, being completely sustainable is a very hard battle and we have to pick and choose sometimes when we can and cannot be the most environmentally friendly as we can be.  
<br><br>

I also find the concept harder to grasp when I know that the plane will be taking off anyway whether I am on it or not.  We do not yet live in a country where enough people are going to make the switch to slow travel, because it is much less convenient than flying, and with the destination being the main point of travel, it is hard to make the switch.  Living in New Jersey and going to school in California does not leave me many options when I have a week of break to see my family and I would have to spend half of that time traveling if I choose to take a bus or train.  Hopefully in the future, when I am traveling for fun or work instead of in a short amount of time, I will factor in travel time without a plane so that I am having a much smaller impact on our earth.  I like the alternatives of using multiple modes of transportation so that you can decrease your footprint slightly, because I do want to be environmentally friendly, but I also haven't figured out how to completely factor out flying from my life.



<br><hr>
I had conflicting opinions about flying after watching this video. While I live in Los Angeles, my parents and brother live in New York. Because of this, I end up flying there and back 2-3 times a year. It is devastating to hear how much this affects my carbon footprint, but I also consider my flying an important part of my life. Truthfully I have never looked into traveling cross country via public transport, but have always assumed it is far too difficult to be practical. What would be necessary is a development in infrastructure. I believe a direct, cross country, high-speed rail would need to be made available at a competitive price to get people to consider public transport over planes. If this were the case, maybe the flight would not fly with that empty seat because enough people could choose the train that fewer planes would have to fly. At this time with current options however, I do not see it being very practical to convince people to avoid flying long distances. In order to get concepts like this pushed through to reality, it comes down to us voting and voicing a need.

<br><hr>
After finishing the video, I was surprised at just how harmful flying can be. While the great majority of the world’s population doesn’t fly, the small percent that does, is enough to make a negative impact on the environment. While I have never flown myself, I can see why flying would be a smart way of travel in some cases, such as traveling for business or in cases of an emergency. That’s why I don’t think it could ever be completely removed as a travel option and I agree with the point you made that it would be hard to regulate this. I always ask myself if an individual’s choices, such as flying, could actually make an impact since many others are still participating in the action. I guess it’s a matter of how much demand there is for airplanes, which I think will continue to be high since not many people are informed of the negative effects.

<br><hr>
I can totally see where you are coming from and I have though about even if I do not catch a plane, it will still fly, but what I put together is that the more of us that decide to use slow travel, the less planes that will take off. This is more of a future aspect on it because obviously it would not be an immediate change, but I believe that there could be less flights needed all around. As for the laws you are mentioning I think it would be a great idea to not be allowed to fly from one city to another. I had a friend fly from San Diego to Santa Barbara when she could have taken a train. When I asked why would you do that she had no logical explanation because for one it cost a lot more and second she knew it just wasn't a smart choice. I think that if we all as a country slowed down a bit we could progressively make these changes from flight to land travel, like a cruise to Hawaii or a train ride to the state of your choice. I took the train to Oregon with my family and it is still one of my favorite memories with them. As for your question about alternative, I can not think of any that would be as fast, but like he said look at the journey instead. Maybe there could be a law in place for businesses to allow a certain amount of days to get to where they need to go instead of them flying? Hopefully we can all think of something for the future!

While I understand that flying is a terrible thing for the environment since it emits so much pollution, it is something that I simply cannot live without. My whole family lives in Brazil, my father is moving to Boston, I have close cousins living in Australia and I also simply love to travel and it’s something I’m not willing to give up. I won’t stop visiting my family and my home country for the sake of the environment because my family values are more important than my environmental values, and I don’t think anyone should. 

<br><br>

However, I do strongly believe that people should look for alternate methods of travel. I have a couple of friends who live in the central valley, which is only a couple of hours away, and they still fly to Santa Barbara over break and sometimes on weekends, because their parents can afford the flights. To me, this isn’t the smartest thing because I consider it an absolute waste of money. If you can take a bus or the train, then you should because even if you can afford something that doesn’t mean you should still buy it. I had never paused to reflect on how much emissions come from planes, but it’s very intuitive when you stop to think about it. I think if people had that reflection, they would probably change some of their short travel habits.

The lecture on “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally” reminds me of environmental injustice, the concept we have discussed before. Ken noted that only 5% of the world’s population is responsible for air travel, and 80% of flights are made by just one percent of all people on the planet. The reason is that traveling by air is extremely exclusive to wealthy people. In the previous video, Ken mentioned that the developed countries including the United States, Europe, as well as Russia have been responsible for nearly two-thirds of all the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, even though these countries only have one-eighth of the world’s population. In contrast, the poorest three billion people, which approaching nearly half of the world’s population, contributed just 5% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. These statistics show us that poor people suffer more from climate change, even though they are not responsible for it. For example, I am not a frequent flyer, but one trip I take each year from the US to China is about 6000-7000 miles which will emit 3.26 tons of CO2. According to Paris accord in order to keep the global temperature rising under two degrees, everyone on the planet should emit no more than two metric tons of CO2 per year. Only one trip from LA to Beijing will expand my entire C02 allocation for a year and a half. Although I always believe I am trying my best to reduce my carbon footprint, only one flight trip will offset all my efforts. What's worse is that other people who have never been flying have to suffer the same consequences.

I had a funny feeling flying was one of the worst things to do for the environment. Overall I thought this lecture was insightful, especially when it came to the figure that 19 out of 20 people have not, and probably never will, step foot on an airplane. That just seemed like a crazy ratio to me with how common flying seems in the United States. But I can understand that most people either can’t afford to fly, or simply have no reason to fly. It really does frustrate me though when I see celebrities jetting all across the country and world as if their plane were a car that they can just start up and get into whenever they want, without any regard as to how that impacts the environment and anybody else other than them. They simply have no concept that what they are doing is horrific for the environment, and that others will inevitably suffer the consequences of their irrational actions. Sports teams are similar. Think of how many sports teams we have in the United States, and then how many of them have to get on planes in order to travel to a different state just to go play another team, all for them to fly back to their home and then have that team fly to them. It’s actually ridiculous when you think about it. I think that celebrities and sports teams that travel regularly should at least have some sort of carbon tax applied to them and their frequent flying. They can certainly afford them, and maybe, just maybe, they will have some semblance of a conscious thought that maybe their lifestyle and traveling is actually a problem for everybody, and instead of flaunting their ability to afford a private jet, they flaunt the fact that today they won’t destroy our environment for the sake of going shopping in New York. Any who, as for myself, I thought that the option to travel by train sounded fun and enjoyable. My parents live in Napa, and I always dread having to drive 6 hours in a car and spend $120 in gas round trip just to see them, but now I am looking at taking a train the next time I go. While the trip may be longer, and they would still have to pick me up in the Bay Area somewhere, it sounds far more enjoyable to enjoy the coast and not have to worry about other drivers, and spend way less money doing it. There are so many things I could do on a train I couldn’t do in my car anyways, like read a book, draw, watch a movie, play games, or enjoy the scenery. Overall it just sounds like a far more enjoyable trip that I am actually looking forward to!

“Flying, the absolute worst you can do environmentally.” The title itself acts as a hook to this week’s lecture video. In previous weeks, Ken kept on talking about the big picture of climate problems. This week, I eventually find something that I can relate with, flying. As an international student, long-way flying is the only way I can get from home to school, and from campus back home. As Ken mentioned, a round fly from LA to Paris will help in 3 tons of greenhouse gas emission (economic class/24 hours), and a round trip from Shanghai to LA takes the exactly same time as from LA to Paris. If I go home every winter, spring and summer break, I will help to emit 9 tons of greenhouse gases a year. I didn’t realize how I am a devil to our environment, but Ken using clod hard date to tell me that I was, am and will be in this lecture video. But great thanks to my home country, the high-speed train has help me to reduce a large portion of greenhouse gas emission when I’m traveling. I’m a traveler, but I don’t need to go anywhere within China by plane since high-speed train has reached to every point of Chinese territory. If the Chinese don’t go abroad, they don’t need to take a single flight travel. Thus, generally, we Chinese are doing great. Yet I am still astonished about the sharp contrast of the data provided in the lecture notes. Ken said there is only 1/20 of the whole global population that has traveled in a flight, and over 80% of flights are set for only 1% of the population. How could that be true? That means only the tiny richest portion of global population is worsening the climate crisis. The whole planet is suffering due to the 1%. I truly apologize for that. The true cost of convenience is terrifying. But flight traveling is a necessity for me. I hope I can figure an alternative out as soon as possible.

Your comment felt really impactful. I don't think you should consider yourself a devil to the environment. It's necessary for you to fly back home, but as you said, you don't travel by plane anywhere within China. Yes, Ken did say that only a tiny portion of the population has the privilege of flying, but I have some issue with you feeling like you are an absolutely horrible person for having to fly. Keep in mind there are corporations who continue to extract fossil fuels and emit tons of co2 into the atmosphere and companies who exploit the environment on a daily basis--and they've been knowingly harming us and the environment for decades. I think if anything they are the devils in this scenario--not someone like you who is trying to get their education at a prestigious institution. My opinion may be problematic, but I feel like the real issue lies within unnecessary flights; like for business trips that perhaps could take over video call instead. Think about every unnecessary private jet the Kardashians, or any wealthy person for that matter, have taken--they've done more damage than you. Yes, some people have higher carbon footprint than others but (probably not with flying) sometimes it's really damn hard to live a life with a low carbon footprint. Think about how difficult it is to not use plastic--of any kind--it's because companies have made it so these things are so engrained into our lives that it becomes nearly impossible to lead zero-waste, low emission lifestyles. Please keep this in mind and don't feel personally responsible for the current state of our environment because you need to fly to and from the US and China to be able to get back home.

It's worth noting that even an ocean is not actually an impassable barrier if you're concerned about environmental impact; one option that I'm not sure Ken mentioned was the possibility of hitching a ride with ocean freighters, who often have extra room on board to help them get through shipping lanes faster. Because the freighters tend to be so big and would have consumed pretty much exactly as much carbon whether or not you decide to go on, it's pretty much the most environmentally friendly way of crossing the ocean short of deciding to try and swim across on your own.

Personally I am not a big flyer. I dont have the  enough money to be flying place to place so I just stay local when it comes to traveling. In the future I would hope to have that privilege to travel but after I listen to this I am having regrets. It is sad to hear that flying takes up most of these green house gases. However I hate to say it, it sounds like a good idea but many people will not listen when it comes to their quick transportation ways. Lets take a look at celebrities. All if not most will take their own private jet or plane when it comes tot traveling even just up the state. They disregard the fact of how bad it is for the environment overall. It saddens me to think this exists because not just air travel but driving is a big pat of everyday life and I doubt it will come to an end.

This Lecture video "Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally" totally refreshes my mind. Honestly, Ken's class can always tell me something that I have never heard of. It is hard to believe all the planes are made for one percent of people on the earth. Every year, I went back to China by plane, because there is no way for international students like me to reach the U.S by train. During the summer holiday, after I went back to China, I travelled from city to city mostly by train. Ken has stated that slow travel can have a good experience. I totally agree with Ken's point. If we travel by train, we can see the scenery around us. It's actually a good idea that people can travel by train. People can save a lot of money and release less pollution. The problem is we can't stop people or debunk those who do not choose the way we want them to be. Because we have to admit that planes are the most convenient way for traveling around the world. And people have the right to choose what they want. The only thing we can do is to let more and more people protect the environment with us.

I am one of those 19 of 20 people who have never been on an airplane. However, it is astonishing to learn that 80% of all flights are made by 1% of the people of the planet. And that leaves me wondering if there is a way to somehow reduce that 1% 's flying to help the environment. Candidly, I don’t know how possible this is as 1% of the population is still approximately 70 million people. 
<br><br>
A few things from this lecture left me confused. Ken said air travel only contributes about 2.5% to greenhouse gases. But he then said that flying can double or triple your carbon footprint. I’m confused as to how this adds up and why that’s the case. Also, I didn’t understand Ken’s point of flying first class as being worse. I don’t understand what difference it makes whether you’re flying first class, coach, or sleeping in the overhead compartment. These are some things I’d love to have cleared up!

I found it interesting that Velazco started off his comment by sharing that he has never been on an airplane before because I found it absolutely shocking that 19 out of every 20 people have never been on an airplane. I have traveled via airplane at least 30 times and I feel like everyone I know has been on an airplane several times. It was also crazy to hear Hiltner say that 80% of flights are taken by 1% of the population. Next, I think I understand a few of the concepts that Velazco was not 100% sure about. Firstly, even though flying only contributes to around 2.5% of greenhouse gas emissions, it is still a major portion of many individual carbon footprints because of the fact that most flights are taken by 1% of people. If a flight from Los Angeles to Paris emits three tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, it is easy for me to see flying doubling or tripling a person’s footprint. Secondly, I think Hiltner points out that flying first class is twice as inefficient (in terms of emissions) as flying coach because travelers flying first class take up twice as much room as travelers flying coach. If there was no first class, there would simply be only coach and each first class traveler would become two coach travelers!

In the lecture video, “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally,”I was surprised to hear that most of the flying is done by the same people with it being only one perecent of the world population accounting for most of it. I would have been a bit from everyone, but it makes sense that it is contributed only from a small group of people since certain professions require lots of flying and wealthier people can afford the cost flying frequently. I think it is a great idea to have more public transports available in every state, especially ones with a large  population. Although there will be a lot of push back from large airport companies and people who are dependent on fast traveling. I think if there was an emphasis on the government putting more restrictions on traveling to discourage flying and promote other alternative options it would be  a good step in lowering the large amount of gas emissions caused from flying. I think that in the future if possible, a large distance public  transportation should be constructed to get to travel to another state would be a great solution. In order to have people’s support  on a project such as this one there has to be a lot more educating on how damaging flying is to the environment and how much of an impact reducing flying could make, but also perhaps more regulation to ensure that flying really is reduced and not just said to be.  I think one of the biggest problems with flying also is the fact that in today’s society is used to having things done at a fast pace and made people impatient since we have gotten used to getting things quickly. I think we need to be conscious that things take time and we might not get everything quick. Since using buses and bikes to get around will probably require more patience since it will probably be slower than the usual transportations we have such as cars. Also from previous videos, discussing how some countries have committed to promoting less environmental ways of getting around such as  biking has set an example. From those videos we have been informed that we do not need to make major investments since we have roads already built that could be used for biking. Of course realistically for bigger distances there would have to be an investment towards buses or perhaps a train, a public transportation that emits less greenhouse gases. I think there is great potential to make mass transportation a lot more environmentally friendly if we give it a chance.

To be honest, I can hardly agree with the opinion said by Ken this week. It is an unrealistic idea, which lets people reduce the time of using the airplane to fly to other countries for myself. I agree with the solutions given by Ken, which said that people could use the train or even ride a bicycle if we decide to go to San Francisco from Santa Barbara. However, I think one of the most important conditions to consider using what kind of transportation is “opportunity cost.” If people have a long holiday and prefer to spend a lot of time on the road instead of the final destination, he or she can indeed choose to play while traveling. However, for myself, I prefer to arrive at my destination as fast as possible and do not want to waste time on the road. The time I spend on the road belongs to the “opportunity cost” and needs to be considered carefully. To give an example, if I want to travel to Orlando this spring holiday, I only have ten days, and I prefer to fly to that place. Suddenly, there is a person who told me that the plane would discharge a large amount of carbon dioxide and you should not go there by plane because you need to protect the environment. I will hold the opinion that this person is crazy. If I have a three months holiday and my family members, who have never come to America, will go to Orlando together, I will consider going there by train because it can let my family members view the beautiful landscape on the road. 
<br><br>
Different situations should let people have different ideas and consideration of a simple thing. To be honest, I hold the opinion that we should not choose some unreasonable ways, which will actually influence and perplex our life, in order to protect the environment.

As Ken makes clear in this lecture, flying has a devastating impact on the environment, and thats with only 5% percent of the world population ever setting foot on an airplane. The CO2 that is emitted from flying even domestically is astronomically high, and I think that commercial flights are only going to increase in the coming years as our population increases and our world becomes increasingly globalized. Flying is an issue that I personally relate to because I am from the east coast. I try to live as sustainably as I can, but the flights I take home for winter break and to visit my family almost make it pointless, because it eats up almost all of my carbon footprint. I try to take measures to reduce how much I fly - for example I don't go home for Thanksgiving even at my parents' request. This past summer, embodying the principle of Long Travel as introduced by Ken, I drove out to school from home with a friend and we made a really fun trip out of it, taking two weeks stoping at national parks and seeing friends at their schools along the way. By doing this we were able to really to cut our carbon footprint in regards to our emissions connected to transportation. However, I wonder how many people who can fly, by that I mean have the financial stability to fly, will embrace this long term travel. The point of flying is to reduce travel time, and I have a hard time seeing a lot of people taking the route I did. Time and efficiency have become such a focal point of our culture. People are always rushing off somewhere and there is this idea that we don't have enough time to take slower means of transportation and this is a huge obstacle for long travel. One way we can start to solve this is by improving our infrastructure and mass transport systems so that people start to see subways, buses, and trains as effective means of transport rather than a 'waste of time'.

I admire your efforts in embodying Long Travel methods. I think people choose to fly instead of taking more time getting somewhere far away using more environmental forms of transit because of the stigma attached to mass transit and because it likely takes more effort to do so. 
<br><br>


Booking a flight from LA to Miami would be pretty simple, but trying to get from one side of the country to the other only using trains and buses would be a task that would require more planning. I could see most people becoming frustrated with the process of figuring out the best ways to get from point A to point B via mass transportation. Additionally, doing this would most likely take way longer to get to your destination. Buses and subways can feel as cramped or more cramped than riding an airplane, and most people would be as equally uncomfortable or less uncomfortable on a plane that takes far less time to get to where you are going. I agree with you that massively improving mass transportation options would see a decrease in people resorting to air travel or driving to get to where they need to go.
<br><br>


After finishing my first year at UCSB this past spring I came to realize how many places in my hometown were a comfortable biking distance away, yet I still usually drove to these destinations. Why? It was faster and I didn't have to worry about potentially climbing hills or being seen by cars. I think the fact that driving is a far less physically grueling mode of transportation than biking and walking is why so many people decide to hop in their cars to go somewhere, even if it is a small distance away.


<br><hr>
I very much agree with you that the aircraft emits many high-concentration pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, ultra-fine particles with a diameter of less than 0.1 micron, etc., which pose a danger to human health. The hot steam discharged from the aircraft cools and solidifies to form very fine particles, which can be sucked into the lungs by the human body, and can even enter the blood circulation, forming oxidative pressure in the blood vessels, inducing inflammation, thereby causing atherosclerosis or arterial obstruction, especially for patients People with cardiopulmonary disorders and asthma can also cause various other deteriorations in their physical health. Through the content of the video, I knew the seriousness of the air pollution from the plane. I decided to use public transportation in the future to minimize the number of planes and contribute to environmental protection.

<br><hr>
I am also from the east coast so I relate completely. I have continuously tried to live more sustainably but flying home and back really leaves an awful impact. The idea of slow travel to school and home seems like an awesome thing to try; people are typically looking for the fastest and most convenient option when it comes to travel, but it isn't necessarily less accessible or expensive than flying to drive or take a bus or train. Not only does it have the potential to show you different parts of the country that you’ve never seen before, but also dramatically impacts the carbon footprint your journey will produce. Yes, slow travel is slow, but in comparison to losing an entire day to a plane ride, what’s taking a few days to explore new things on the way to your destination? 
<br><br>

We absolutely need to be improving upon the standards at which our current means of public transportation operate. Those types of travels should be incentivized towards all travelers as they are truly viable alternative solutions to the impacts of flight travel. Especially in urban areas, it’s important for transportation to be readily available, accessible to all, and not costly, if not free.


<br><hr>
Air tickets are not a question of price reduction now, but should be raised to remind passengers that as a result of abandoning trains and choosing planes, it will cause greater pollution to the global environment. And because the number of passengers who choose to transport passengers has been increasing, this has hindered the improvement of aviation technology to some extent. In order not to affect climate change, air pollution reduction actions are just as important as other actions. The key issue is that the government must change the direction of resources investment and make railways bear the heavy responsibility of transportation.

<br><hr>
The government isn't going to go ahead and reduce air travel if they can't even agree that the climate crisis is real. 
<br><br>
If companies are shown that the consumers, however, are no longer utilizing air travel, whether for monetary reasons or environmental reasons, they will play more into the slow travel business. Companies don't care about their impact in the long run, they care about what demand is and meeting that demand to profit off of it. At least until the government can come to a kind of consensus on this incredibly important issue, companies will continue to try and capitalize off of that disagreement; it's more a matter of what people want at this current moment, which happens to be air travel because it's convenient and fast. 
<br><br>
My point was simply that by making it an economic incentive to use transportation options such as trains, buses, etc. more folks would begin using that over air travel, regardless of their beliefs on the climate crisis, which would undoubtedly have a positive impact on our collective carbon footprint, rather than waiting for everyone to agree that there's an issue.

<br><hr>
 I agree with most of your points stated in the comment. Even though we are forced, or say that we should be more considerate about our environment, to fly less or use effective mass transportation, people are still having trouble figuring out their plans from place to place. (Here I mean far places such as from the East coast to the West coast of the US) We already get used to our lives nowadays, which is also a difficult task to make changes through these actions. However, it is our mind that controls what we do and say. If one has any or slight thought of reducing the carbon footprint each of us contributes, it still can happen one day. After all, I still feel hoped to see the improvements.

This lecture just proves that no matter who you are or how much money you have, you are going to have to give something up no matter what. We all have things we enjoy, but that are harmful to the planet. Some people can’t go a week without a hamburger, others love to shop, others want to have 5 kids. For me, I absolutely love to travel. I plan to study abroad and want to see as much of this awesome world as I can. It is so upsetting to learn that flying is the worst thing you can do for the planet because that is the way that we are able to go out and see the world. Us wanting to go experience and enjoy our planet is actually what is contributing to its dying. I found it very surprising that a flight from LA to Paris emits 3 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, which would be equivalent to the amount each person is supposed to emit for one and a half years. Your entire allowed footprint for one and a half years is used up in just about 24 hours. Also, the fact that 19/20 people have never been on a plane shows just how privileged people who are able to fly truly are and most celebrities and elites that fly are flying first class which is twice as harmful, making their footprint even larger. While getting out and seeing the planet we live on is a very enriching and inspiring experience, it also increases our individual carbon footprints by a lot so collectively it is a big issue. It is hard to realize that we are all going to have to give up things that we love to do, but at the same time, we now have the chance to find new things that are more sustainable and just as enriching. I truly feel that the sacrifice is 100% worth it and that the wellness and state of our planet is much more important than anything else because the planet is home to everything we love.

Flying is the worst thing you can do was a surprising look at how flying affects the global CO2 emissions. While it only contributes for 2% of how much CO2 is in the atmosphere, it still remains one of the worst things that can be done to the environment. Ken also comments on how flying is perceived as glamorous and something that people well off do. WHile it is true that it is mainly the upper percentile of Americans that fly using private jets and fly more often, it is the perception of how the average American view this as desirable that is the issue. I did like the different methods suggested to lower CO2 emissions while travelling, however. One of my favorite things that Ken suggested was the notion of using more Facetime and other digital media in order to lessen the amount people fly. I know people who are always flying from place to place for business meetings and whatnot, but I thought this was a very creative and smart way to try and lower that number.

Prof. Hiltner pointed out that flying reduces carbon the most. I am so sorry to know about that this late. As an international student, I have to fly on plane to across the Pacific Ocean fourtimes a years. I cannot even imagine how much carbon I emitted just by flying. I have to say I did not have much evident feeling of emitting carbon is what I am doing right know and right here every day until last week. The fact that just by having a car and flying on a place is producing this much carbon and poking a hole on the ozone is just shocking. For me as a one of the generation born in 2000, this might be a surprising fact. But for my children and my grandchildren, this might just be another support for them to be angry at us. So take some actions, people!

Air travel only contributes a small percentage, 2 to 2.5 percent, to global greenhouse gas emissions. Although this may seem small and insignificant, it is a problem that we can solve. Any positive change that we make will go a long way! Traveling by air is almost twice as bad for the environment than traveling by car is. One way to combat this problem is public transportation. Instead of traveling to texas on plane, we should consider traveling to Texas via bus or train. However, what if you absolutely need to fly (like for a business trip)? It is suggested that, instead of taking one trip every year for five years, we should consider having one big trip every five years. This will greatly lessen our carbon footprint. Although I have only flown on an airplane one time, this makes me think about the Kim Kardashian’s of the world, who seem to fly EVERYWHERE and how much that hurts our planet. It is sad to see celebrities nowadays not make a change in their lifestyles.

I hate flying. I’ve only ever been on a plane twice and both times I hated it. The plane is crowded with tons of people, you have to rush and get up super early hours beforehand to get past TSA and security, and this whole time you’re waiting to get on a means of transportation that could consume a person’s year long 2 ton threshold of CO2 within hours. And not to mention there are better ways to get around at least within a certain range. Sure, if you want to go out of the country to Europe, or maybe you have to go across the country, then I think flying is acceptable and reasonable. However, I think it becomes a problem when people start using air travel as if it was a perfectly meager way of getting around like a car or train. People who fly on a weekly basis, or even those who take planes twice a year for vacation or other reasons, are the people who are contributing very significant and immediate amounts of CO2 directly into the atmosphere. Air travel can’t be sustained and also used on a very frequent basis if we are to help the planet. I really liked Ken’s idea of slow travel. I never thought about it before, but part of the fun of going on a trip or an adventure is the actual traveling part. Would it take longer to use the train system or take a car or some other means of transportation? Yes of course it would, but more importantly you get to enjoy the actual journey of the trip, not simply the location. I really find this idea to be quite interesting because it’s something no one ever suggests or talks about. If you wanted to go on a vacation, then take the time to plan out a trip from point A to point B, don’t just hop on plane and emit dangerous levels of CO2 just to get to the destination faster. In the end, yes Americans need to reduce their air travel as it is simply the worst thing someone could do to immediately release tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

As a person who does frequent trans-continental travelling, this lecture has a profound impact on me. Having families on the other side of the planet makes me have to pay visits to them at least once a year, which means I have to take these 12 hour minimal flights twice a year. In Ken’s words, that's about 4 metric tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. However, if we want to strictly follow the limit imposed by Paris accord, we not only burned all of our fossil emission for this year, but also next year, and that’s all the top of us not driving any cars, purchasing any products and consuming any meat. As a relatively frequent flyer, these thoughts of carbon emission and environmental pollution had never been in my head until I watched this video. And I have to pause and ponder these harm I had done to the environment. How crazy that take all these environment-costly luxuries for granted, while most of the population on this planet don’t even stand a chance for this kind of opportunity. Meanwhile, the impact we have on the environment due to our travelling behavior are usually invisible to us, and I believe that was primarily the reason why we continue with our environmentally disastrous habits. That “2 metric ton of CO2” we emitted just seems so distant to us and it would just never come to our mind like it doesn’t exist. I think a good way to help solving this problem starting from ourselves is to cut back unnecessary travelling. For me, I think I can travel back once every two years instead of once a year. Plus, it is not like I would never see them thanks to real-time remote interaction technologies like facetime and skype like Ken mentioned in the lecture.

Interesting for sure how we see what is completely detrimental to the planet, as Ken said, “glamorous” and also massively convenient. 
 <br><br>
     I also travel a lot, and I honestly think if I counted up all the flights I have been on in my lifetime… It is well over 150. I am pretty embarrassed to admit that with the new knowledge from this lecture, I am that 1% who contributes to 80% of all flights made. Already in 2020 I have been on 5 separate plane flights. 
 <br><br>
Ever since that lecture video where Ken brought up the 2 metric ton of CO2 per person per year to achieve the Paris Climate Accord goals, I can’t get it out of my mind. Every action I take like a trip to the store, plugging my phone in at night to charge, or buying food, that number rings in my head and I wonder to myself how far over that 2 metric tons have I already gone by the second month of this year. I don’t even want to know, especially with how environmentally conscious I consider myself. 
    <br><br>
  I did like Ken’s alternatives though. Especially that of “slow travel.” A trip across the country sounds amazing but for that price as a college student, that’s really tough. Out of curiosity I looked at the price of a trip from California to New York by train for my upcoming (hopeful) trip this summer. I’m not sure how accurate the website was from what I saw, but the price of a train ticket was double that of a plane ticket, and also took 3.5 days instead of 6 hours. I get that a long time is the whole point of slow travel, but considering that’s an extra 6 days of food and time off work and if I want to sleep in a hotel 6 nights paying for that as well AND double the price of flying… that is really tough on the wallet. Are there any tips / tricks I’m missing?


<br><hr>
I think real-time remote interaction technologies are some of the most impactful and exciting technologies being invented and implemented today. Using these as a substitute for frequent flying is the perfect way to help combat your carbon footprint. But I think everyone understands that skype can only substitute face-to-face interaction for so long. No matter what technologies are created, I just don't see this not being a problem. In your case, you're eventually going to want to go and visit your family and really get to see what it's like to live where they do, and live like they do. So what then? 
    <br><br>

I think a severely underappreciated form of travel is via boat. While not very quick, perhaps one day the speed at which you can travel by boat will increase and make it comparable to flying. Or even better, we are able to build long-distance, underwater railway systems akin to what they have in Britain/France. Maybe what I've said here reiterates what Ken said in this video, but I hope that one day you'll be able to visit your family without the concern of over-exerting your carbon footprint.

This was one lecture that I actually didn’t feel horrible about being shitty to the environment. I have only been on 2 trips that have required flight travel and they were spread out like 8 years. What shocked me the most is that only 5% of the population has been in a plane but that just reveals that we are in a bubble of wealth here in the states. But I definitely would prefer slow travel so I agree with Ken and I know the 1% can abuse flight travel. Where I would disagree is that slow travel is just not as practical and there are situations where people have to travel for their jobs or careers. Some people may have to travel 500 miles in a day and slow travel just wouldn't cut it. My stance on air travel has definitely shifted after this lecture. I believe air travel should be used out of necessity rather than a luxury. I think the implementation of High-Speed rail would cause a lot more people to consider taking the train rather than a plane at least in California. Hopefully, that doesn't turn out to be JUST as harmful to the environment.

“Life is a journey, not a destination,” is a saying that a lot of us don’t take into consideration. Being here at UCSB, many of us are trying to figure out what we want to do with the rest of our lives. We’re so focused on following a path that will lead us to our success, but what we don’t realize is how it might eventually lead us to our doom. This really correlates to how our vision of success is also environmentally detrimental. We are so focused on what people thing of us that we lose track of what’s really important - which is how our human behaviors affect our surroundings. I was really shocked to hear how a flight from LA to Paris can contribute to 3 tons of CO2 to be emitted into the atmosphere and if you travel first class, it emits 2x’s more CO2. And the fact that its 19/20 people have never stepped foot onto a plane, yet flying contributes so much to climate change is saying a lot. Professor Ken brought up alternatives on how we should travel to reduce our carbon footprint. Although the idea of slow traveling sounds great scenically due to how fast paced our society is, I don’t necessarily think it’s realistic for a majority of us whose only option to get places is. air travel. There are also many people who can’t afford to try this route due to life obligations. I feel like these alternatives are for people who can afford it. Not monetarily, but time wise. Although Ken has stated that we shouldn’t rely on technology to solve our problems, I think that we should figure out ways in which we can make air traveling more environmentally friendly.

I found myself feeling guilty while watching this lecture. I normally fly a couple times a year for vacation or visiting family. When Ken started the lecture by saying “air travel is only 2.5% of the total greenhouse emission globally,” I was immediately confused why we were talking about air travel as an environmental issue. However, after finishing the lecture, I realized why. It is crazy that only 19 out of 20 people around the world have been on a plane and 80% of flights are from 1% of the population. This means that only a small percent of people is contributing to an issue that is affecting everyone globally. We’ve seen this pattern before in other films and lectures. The poorest countries are emitting a fraction of the CO2 in the atmosphere. It is the wealthiest countries like the United States that are the core of the problem. However, it is the poorest counties will be affected by climate change the most.
<br><br>
I agree with you. While Ken’s tips of reducing air travel by having longer vacations less often, using video calling such as Skype and Facetime, and changing modes of transportation could potentially be effective, it is not efficient enough for the fast-American lifestyle. I believe the only way to reduce the amount of air travel is to create a different mode transportation that is cheaper while maintaining efficiency. High speed trains are the answer. This technology has already shown to be effective in Europe. When I was in Europe, my family and I took the Eurostar underwater train from Paris to London. The entire trip only took 2.5 hours. If the US implemented more high-speed trains, I think Americans would slowly switch from planes to trains.


<br><hr>
I agree. Although the alternatives like slow travel, train, biking, and busing are good options that in all honestly seem really pleasant and fun, it's really only accessible to people who have the time, resources, and money to do it. I feel like a lot of the reason people fly is to get somewhere they otherwise couldn't get to with other modes of transportation. I know that's why I do it. I'm from Northern California and, at least where I live, it would be a lot more of a hassle/more expensive/take a LOT longer to get from my hometown to college than to take a plane. I think last week's discussion of mass transportation plays into this a lot- at least in the USA public/mass transportation isn't very reliable because most of our land/population is in suburban areas- in that sense it's hard to get other places via public transportation because in most places either there isn't any, it's too expensive, or it's unreliable. I think if we implemented the solutions we saw in the video about  Bogota, Colombia and found ways to make trains/subways/buses more accessible/reliable, as well as more accessible bike paths, then the solutions Ken offered would be a lot more realistic and a lot less intimidating to the public. I also agree that making air travel more environmentally friendly seems like an option that should've been addressed more- with the advancements we've made in technology recently, I feel really hopeful that we can make air travel a lot less damaging to the environment.
<br><hr>
I like how you brought the concept close to home, relating it to UCSB and ultimately the dominate mindset of the population. I also agree that we need better alternatives than slow travel IF we want transportation other than air travel to be more present in our choices. For example, some UCSB students have class the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving, or when allowed time off for work, people are only given four to five days. As the journey IS important, time is definitely a factor. I think a better alternative is improving train or subway systems to be faster and reach more destinations. Given that it is already relatively cheaper in most cases, if it were more fitting to our schedules, I think there would be a much greater shift towards its use. Also, the fact that 19/20 people globally have never used air travel makes me reflect on my own use of air travel and the U.S.'s heavy use in general. There has to be a model somewhere globally that we can mirror or build from to make other forms of travel more popular here in the U.S. 
<br><br>
Also, the language used in the video of me flying once every 3/4 months single handedly nullify-ing/counteracting the gains from other individual conscious efforts I make is phrasing I think we should definitely avoid as it is discouraging of personal difference.

In the lecture snippet, “Flying, the Absolute Worst Thing You Can do Environmentally”, it distinguishes how flying uses 2.5% of greenhouse gas globally and how it distinguishes that it is making a negative impact to the planet. This encourages me to stop flying and instead of going on far away vacations go to places that are more locally and be more involved with my community. There are 19 out of 20 people who haven’t stepped foot on a plane, and distinguishes that 80% of the people that affect the air quality are the one percent that actually use airplanes as transportation. This impressed me how a small percentage of people who transport through planes actually make a big impact on our air quality and how it can bring negative effects because of it. It is crazy how you put it into account how if you do go on a plane, it can affect the planet greatly. It is interesting how a single action can cause an enormous effect on our planet and how we should revise our actions and make sure it is improving and boosting our planet. It is also interesting how the technology is improving and expanding, so that we don’t have to visit people across the states or countries just to see them. We can use our technological devices to help us communicate and bond  with our family members and close friends. As well, we can use different types of other public transit to get to our destinations like buses or trains. This would be far more effective and approachable than flying on planes.

I see where you are coming from when you mention new technology allows us to be in contact with those we love and eliminates the need to see them in person, but I wanted to share a different perspective. For people going to college or working in different parts of the world than their loved ones, technological communication can only suffice for so long. And what about people who live in completely different time zones? Facetiming or texting in real time then becomes an issue. I may only feel this way because I have a long-distance boyfriend, who I am flying to see in about a week. Of course, I agree that limiting flights is important, and one could ask me, what will I do if our planet dies? If flying is such a hazardous act and could lead to our demise and we all die, I would have no boyfriend to visit anymore. Being an out of state student also means I must take decently long flights just to go home over breaks. Such flying should be allotted to that one "giant" vacation Ken mentioned, but instead I do it every few months. Traveling via train is often much more cost effective and of course more sustainable than flying, but sometimes that journey would take up the entirety of my vacation time. As a college student, I don't have the leeway to travel for 3 days to get home and then 3 days back. I would be home for about a day over spring break and might as well just stay on campus if I was allowed to. I'm sure similar situations apply to those out of college working 9-5 jobs. Basically, I'm trying to say that I agree flying is horrible for our environment, and if I could cut down on doing it so much I would, except it is difficult to do so as an out of state college student with the schedule I am on. I could always stay at a friend's house and choose not to go home, but weighing the benefits to the environment with the emotional strain of being away from my loved ones for so long, I know I would be selfish and still fly home.

It really is unfortunate that there can not be better alternatives to air travel that would also not significantly disadvantage the flier. Out of the techniques to help reduce air travel I think that telepresence and taking less but longer trips would be the most realistic way to reduce your footprint.I honestly do not see most fliers converting to slow travel because most would not want to give up days worth of their vacation in order to travel in a different way. I think the only way to get people away from airplanes is to keep raising air flight prices to the point that most would not desire them, as controversial is this is and something I personally would not want. People value two things very heavily: their time and their money. I don’t see people willing to sacrifice that much of their time unless they have to significantly sacrifice their money. 
<br><br>

Air travel also brings about the issue that only the wealthy get to take advantage of it, but the rest of the world are the ones who feel the effects. In one flight, just a little less than 24 hours, you use up even more than your entire annual co2 emission limit set by the Paris Accord. For me, this makes me feel really guilty because I fly somewhat frequently because I am from Massachusetts and use air travel to get home. I wouldn’t be opposed to train travel if I had the time to do so, but in reality I wouldn’t want to give up my limited days of being home to sit on a train for a few days. This is an unfortunate reality for most people who prioritize air travel. I think one thing that Ken mentioned that would be easier to achieve is to prioritize telepresence more when it comes to business travel because it causes 100 times less of an environmental impact and the same goals can be accomplished. Also a lot of the people flying in first class, which emits 2 times as much carbon dioxide, are flying for business and because their company pays for the flight. I also agree that it would be more beneficial to take one big trip every once in a while instead of smaller shorter ones frequently. As fliers, we can make conscious efforts to reduce the amount we travel and only take planes when absolutely necessary.

I too look back at how I travel. I don't bike or ride the train to UCSB, nor fly, which according to research and Ken is best, but I catch a ride in a car. My parents or my friend will drive me to and from UCSB. I don't go back often but give me a three day weekend and I'll most likely start packing to head back home. So yes I too am concerned about my carbon footprint in travel. But like everyone else I can't just bike back home, it's about 13hrs 46 more or less with non-stop biking according to google maps. As a female I have a couple of fears doing this so I'm not going to choose this anytime soon. But I do consider traveling a valid way back home. It would cost less and is more Eco friendly. Only thing is my parents are not comfortable (well more afraid of the idea of me traveling alone with possible dangerous encounters) with me traveling alone by train. Which I understand, like Ken said it's not that easy to change, but little by little it can happen.

Flying is a tricky subject when it comes to the climate crisis. As Ken stated, it is the worst thing you can do environmentally because of the immense amount of CO2 it puts in the atmosphere. However, I find that flying also has lots of benefits. If you fly (assuming it is to a different culture), one can become more culturally versed and more respectful of these cultures. You could feel connected to a certain culture and actually feel emotions for a place when something goes wrong. It will make one more open-minded, which in the state we are today, is highly useful and necessary. Let's say, for example, I traveled somewhere and I saw first hand the poverty and poor working conditions of these people. Imagine that I talked to these people for a little bit and made a connection with them. Because of this experience, I would probably be more inclined to act in a way that supports people in these poor conditions. 
<br><br>

Without these personal connections and experiences, there lies a disconnect between cultures. This is what I realized as the main issue in what was shown in the film "The True Cost." People in the US lack any personal connection to these cultures, and as a result, don't care about how our consumer culture affects these lives halfway around the world. With this said, I think travel is highly valuable in shaping how people act.
<br><br>

However, I do see the devastation that flying inflicts. It's absolutely crazy that a flight from LA to Paris can use our individual carbon budget for 1.5-3 years. In the future, I plan to limit my air travel and instead, try and use some of these slower forms of transportation, such our train system.

I think that most people that fly aren't humanitarians that want to travel to see the world of how it truly is. Most, I would assume, are flying for work or vacation (where they would want to visit the nicest of places and cultures). It's true that these forms of travel can give awareness to the impoverished and suffering throughout the world, but I see the same argument could be given with the Internet in the rapid spread of information. I think the true value in air travel is the ability to work anywhere anytime if your job skillset allows it. It also gives the chance for others to experience cultures and visit sites people centuries ago wouldn't have imagined doing. All of this comes at a great cost of CO2 emissions unfortunately.

The lecture video "Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally" highlights the impacts of flying on our environment. Planes emits greenhouse gases from burning fuel which contribute to global warming in our atmosphere. Although it is only 2.5% of all global emissions, it is how we, as individuals, personally choose to fly our planes, whether that be economy or first class or a private jet plane. The influences from rich people can harm their surroundings.Although rich people are disproportionally responsible for damaging our environment, they would be the last to be hurt. Wealth conceals empathy.  It is shocking to me how one flight can produce 2-3 tons of carbon emissions to the environment. Ultimately I recommend to fly less when you can. Instead of taking a an hour flight somewhere,  you can always go by car or a train, and enjoy the view and experience the ride that you could not admire from an altitude.

With only 5% of people currently flying and flying being the worst thing a human could do in terms of the environment, it is scary to think what impact flying could take on the environment if it becomes increasingly accessible to countries that have very limited access to it right now. Considering China has increased air travel by 50% in the last 5 years, this is a very imminent threat to the environment.  The unfortunate part of this situation is that I feel as though it is almost impossible to get people to stop using air travel at this velocity, as in many cases it is unavoidable. I think Ken's solutions were interesting, however not completely reasonable in most cases. Although it seems nice to be able to to sit back on a train all the way up the coast of California and enjoy the view in order to save emissions on an airplane ride, most people do not have the luxury of taking an extra day off of work/school/away from their family/etc and therefore this is not an option. I think it is an interesting concept to avoid layover flights by taking advantage of things like busses and trains to get to the layover destination, however it is just not doable for the average person. I think air travel and the emissions it lets out is a very scary concept, and I think one of the only ways to really reduce its impact is to try to avoid traveling by plane all together unless it is absolutely necessary. Like Ken states in this video, face to face interactions are becoming less meaningful due to social media, so hopefully in this aspect meetings and conversations in the future that used to require air travel could be turned digital in the name of saving the environment.

In the lecture, the professor suggests that the worst trip that people can take environmentally is taking the plane. Although air travel only contributes two and half percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions, it offers people a very quick way to contribute to the climate crisis. Professor states that it is essential to let people realize and look back to our own actions. For me, 
<br><br>
I love taking planes to travel all around the world, because it is much more convenient than driving or taking a train. I just need to spend a little more money, then I am able to travel further with less time and enjoy the service on the plane. But behind all those benefits, just one round trip from LA to Paris would cause three tons of carbon dioxide to be directly emitted into the upper atmosphere. Those statistics make me feel bad, because I always want to protect the Earth and slow down global warming, but at the same time I am still damaging the environment due to my personal needs. After this lecture, I understand the reason that even though air travel is not the main cause of greenhouse gas, it is still considered as the worst way of traveling. It reminds me that next time I travel from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, I should probably take the train instead of taking the plane. 
<br><br>

Another interesting point that is mentioned in the lecture is that the air travel is actually a way of showing privilege. Because 19 out of 20 people have never taken a plane before, so this transportation is for a small amount of wealthy people. And these people no matter if they are frequent flyers or just randomly take the plane are contributing much more greenhouse gases than those who have never taken the plane before. It is important to let people realize their actions are harming the environment, so they can change and choose more eco friendly ways to travel.

Flying being the worst thing that a person can do to the environment puts me in a big moral dilemma. I am an environmental studies major and I am a vegetarian and I don’t buy fast fashion but flying is something that is hard for me to avoid. I live in New Jersey but I go to school in California, meaning if I ever go home it is a long flight. I never fly first class and I only go home about twice a year but still the implications are huge on the planet and blow my carbon footprint through the roof. If only there was a cheaper, more energy efficient way to get across the country. It feels as though I don’t have any other option and I don’t want to be unable to see my family. Additionally, I have moved many times throughout my life, one of the places being England. The journey overseas is long and the only real option is to fly. It is very frustrating because as much as I do to keep my carbon footprint small, flying will always destroy the efforts I make.

Flying accounts for only 2% of carbon emissions. We emit 3 tons of carbon dioxide from a round trip to Paris from LAX.  This would use up your carbon emissions for a year and a half even if you were living an environmentally conscientious lifestyle.  Mononitrogen Dioxide increases short term impact. 80% of all flights are made by just 1% of the planet. Aren’t these facts alarming? I definitely did not know all of this before watching this video. WE are among the 1% when we fly in regards to carbon emissions. How then are we supposed to change the culture of flying? There should be campaigns and advertisements for bus passes like there are mass advertisements for airlines. You can get flight miles. Why is there not a rewards program for traveling by bus? It’s probably because only lower income populations use buses in much of America and advertisements companies want to cater to the public that can pay for expensive traveling. 
<br><br>

The individual cost of long distance travel does seem to be cheaper if we travel by plane, however once you factor in family sizes, the cost of flying becomes much more expensive. Yet, so does the travel by train. If we could have incentives from riding by train rather than flying I think people would be more likely to chose this way of travel. 
<br><br>

I like the video you showed in lecture today where the man put a higher priority into having bike lanes that were functional rather than street. He gave lower income people pride and dignity while reducing the overall emissions in his city. This is what I would like to see American cities attempt to implement.

The lecture on “Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally” is pretty informative and teaches me some facts about flying by airplanes. Ken claims that air travel would cause and bring a huge amount of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Actually, I am shocked by the fact that 80% of flights are made by just one percent of all people on the planet. Since air travel is so common in the world and there is a vast amount of flights in the world every day, I cannot believe that only such a small percentage of people take the airplane. This lets me think about what Ken said in the previous lecture that developed countries contribute to most of CO2 to the atmosphere and largely cause climate change. Although China is a developing country, there are a lot of people travel by airplanes and air travel in China increased by 50%. It is a large number. After that, I start thinking about the future of air travel since more and more people start taking the airplane. The impacts of air travel to the environment would be more dramatic and larger. One of the solutions to this issue that Ken proposes is that breaking down the travel into parts so that in some small parts, we can use a more convenient and environmental-friendly method---by train. It is a really helpful suggestion because it will really help mitigate the influence of air travel to the climate and encourage people to enjoy the small trip and discover the beauty of locals in the way. It is really reasonable and workable. In the future trip, I would consider this method and try my best to reduce the emission of CO2 caused by my personal air travel.

I was also surprised to hear that only one percent of the entire population of the world are the ones who have flown on eighty percent of all flights. I thought that at least five percent of the entire population have flown on a plane at least once in their lifetime. Ken mentions that we can break down travel into parts so we can be more environmentally friendly and that sounds nice but I don't think that it is realistic. He says that it takes 3 days to get to San Francisco from Santa Barbara on a bike which means that we need to take an extra week off of work just to take a one day trip. Let's say that I own a small company in Santa Barbara that is going to make a huge business deal in San Francisco that could help grow my company but there is one problem, I have to meet up in person and the next day I have to be back in Santa Barbara for work. I would not be able to go there and back as quick as a plane so I could get back on time. Yes you can say that I can take the train but even that may not be convenient because there might be things that could get in the way of me making it on time on the train making impossible for me to get another train time to get back on time if I don’t fly or drive. Driving gives me the flexibility to leave whenever I want and it doesn't have to be on a schedule. I think that we have to find different ways to make travel more efficient and more environmentally friendly.

After watching this lecture, I too, was shocked by the level of harm air travel causes in respect to the climate crisis. It seems completely exaggerated to say that 19 out of 20 people will never fly, and is even crazier to think that 80% of all flights are taken by a measly 1% of the population given the amount of people that fly on airplanes everyday. The amount of carbon one emits from flying roundtrip from Los Angeles to Paris (3 metric tons) is enough to blow your acceptable carbon emissions (2 metric tons per year) for 1.5 years. Even worse, flying this distance in first class emits double (6 metric tons). There is such a large amount of people that are flying these long distances on a regular basis, which means something has to be done. Although a much fewer percent of people, the elite of the world fly privately, making me wonder  how much carbon a single flight for these people emits into our atmosphere. Although the solution suggested by Ken, taking trains and other forms of transportation, is a good one for domestic travel, I do have to disagree with the possibility that this will actually happen on the scale we would hope for. Although I have no idea the logistically possibility of this being done, I feel a better way to lower the emissions of air travel is to experiment with different fueling options for planes. I know it may be difficult, but if it’s already been done with cars and other modes of transportation, I don’t see why the switch can’t be made for planes as well.

This lecture brings up the point that air travel is bad for the environment. Though I agree, I don’t see people changing up their way of travel anytime soon. I travel by plane once or twice a year to go visit family. Flying isn’t really the best experience since airports are such a hassle and the plane is very crowded and annoying. Last time I traveled, there was a baby crying the whole flight which can get annoying pretty quickly. But I would think most people would rather be stuck on a 3 hour flight with these experiences, than sit on a train for about a whole day. Also, a lot of people need to travel for work, so not giving them the option to fly would affect people financially. In order to change this, we need to carefully transition to another method of transportation that won’t affect how we currently live. As of now, flying is just way more convenient and until we find a different way of travel that would get us to our destination just as fast, it isn’t going to change any time soon.

It is surprising to know that environmentally the worst thing you can do is flying. I used to think that cars might be the ones since we have so many but it is actually airplanes. But I think to reduce how much people fly is very hard since nowadays we are well-developed and people want to communicate with friends far away from flight is the best way and maybe the only way to do so. However, like Ken said, we can reduce it in someways such as calculate the route carefully can choose the most environment-friendly route. I also like the slow trip Ken suggests, in this way you can enjoy the environment along the trip but I don’t think it is applicable for most people since people usually take flights to reduce travel time. This is still a serious problem to consider, maybe we should reduce the times of flights within the country like in China we have the most developed high-speed rail in the world and most people take them instead of flights.

I understand that flying is terrible for the environment, but I and probably 99.9% of people will not gve up flying unless teleportation or some other faster method becomes available. Most people do not have the luxury of taking six days off of work to take a train or bike or bus long distances. A plane is just too convenient and fast to pass up for most people. Ideally people will stop flying, but for only 2% of the global emissions, it is not that bad. I do not think slow travel will be wide spread, but maybe some will begin to practice it. It is one of those things, that I personally see as "trendy" to do and not done with 100% intention to save the planet. 

<br><br>

I do, however, think that flights are being taken at too high of a rate when they are not that necessary. As you mentioned, business travel makes little sense at this point in time due to video calls and conferences. While flying is bad for the planet, no other reasonable alternative is around, at least in my opinion.

No matter how optimistic a person can be, they would have to agree with you on your point on air travel. When we are granted the convenience of air travel not many people would pass up on the opportunity to reach their destination faster. I also agree with both you and Ken that at this point traveling for business is unnecessary considering that you call or video chat with anyone across the globe. 
 <br><br>

Slow travel is a great alternative for taking a flight, but it might seem a little inconvenient to most because it takes much more time to reach their destination, which is time that some people cannot afford. I also agree that people might see slow travel as ‘trendy’ and not with the intention of saving the planet, but it becoming a trend can also be a great help to the environment, whether or not people intend to do so. I hope slow travel becomes widespread and for those people who could do this will because it will make a significant impact.

I was not aware that flying in airplanes is one of the worst things to do. It was so crazy that a round trip flight from Los Angeles to Paris would contribute 3 tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Flying first class was twice as worse which made so much sense. As stated by Ken, “80 percent of all flights are made by just 1 percent of the population”. I found this insane because it just shows how the wealthy are the only ones contributing to this issue basically. The wealthy countries make poorer countries suffer their consequences. However, flying only contributes to just 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, but it’s being specifically done by the wealthy. I think not flying at all is very doable, but taking one longer, more grand vacation once every couple of years is better than taking a bunch of shorter ones more consistently. Also, people should consider other forms of transportation when doable with their schedule and limitations.

I totally agree with the professor’s idea that  life is not all about destination, and the journey towards it is as important as the destination. I always thinks that the journey is really amazing part of traveling. On the way to the destination we can have a good time with our family or friends and view the landscape around us while imagining what the destination would be like. In my mind this is what the trip should be like. Therefore, this is the reason why I like to travel slowly myself. 
<br><br>

Moreover, after watching the lecture video, I was surprised by how much green house gas can a single flight emit for a person. Before watching the video, I think that travel by plane is also a kind of public transportation which is similar to bus that can be environmentally friendly, because there are so many people on a single plane. However, the fact is that flying can emit tons of carbon dioxide for a single person, and siting in the first class can produce double the size. This is really a terrific fact which teaches me that it is not good for the environment to fly too much. Especially, for those unnecessary flights, which can be replaced by other environmentally friendly transportations. 
<br><br>

It is very important to inform more and more people about this, because I think there are many ones like me who does not realize the damage flying can do. So that we need to tell them the right thing to do.

I agree that we need to make a dramatic societal shift away from relying on air travel and education is a great place to start. Embarking on “slow travel” vacations is a great idea that would begin to eliminate the necessity for airplanes and may completely transform the way we view vacationing. But before we even do that, I believe the greatest thing we can do is educate people. Before watching this video, I had no idea the serious consequences that arose from flying. If anything, I thought traveling by car was worse. Now that I know about the detrimental effects, I cause everytime I step on a plane, I am definitely going to reconsider how I travel if other options are available. Just this year alone, I have flown on a plane numerous times and after watching Ken’s video, I am quite embarrassed to know how much has been emitted because of my actions. I live about 11 hours away, so traveling home on a plane is much more time efficient and convenient for my busy life. Although it may take longer, I am definitely going to look at other options when traveling home next time in hopes I will not continue to add to my emissions. Through education, I have found that I need to make lifestyle changes regarding traveling. I am eager to implement them into my life next time I embark on a vacation. I think there would be countless other Americans who would also be willing and eager to make these lifestyle changes as well if they simply knew about the detrimental effects of flying. Never in my life have I seen an advertisement or billboard displaying this type of information. While it is most likely that airline and fossil fuel industries play a huge role in this, I believe we need to work to make this information more mainstream.

It is unfortunate to hear how terrible air travel is for the environment. Air travel is usually an unavoidable decision. You can’t drive across the Pacific if you want to get to Hawaii. And no one sailing to the hotel in Maui. In this, I see that the wealthy are getting blamed for this vice to the climate. But many middle-class and even lower-income people fly as well. Whether this is for business, family, or foreign travel, it is usually an unavoidable expense. I’m curious to see how we overcome this since we definitely cannot include flight in our carbon budgets. Will we be able to go to other countries we have to sail. Hopefully, we devise a monorail that gets us over to Europe in a couple of hours. I don’t know, but we definitely cannot keep air travel as it is today.

Knowing that flying is the absolute worst thing you can do not shock me; However, knowing that it only contributes to 2.5% of my carbon footprint. It is crazy that such a small percentage is the worst thing you can do. Luckily, I live in Southern California so I can take the Amtrak back home. Before this class the only reason I did not take a plane back home was because of money, but now if I did have the money I would still take the Amtrak. Although I still need to take the train and drive two hours I still think it is better than flying. It sucks knowing that people have private jets because they probably have no idea how much greenhouse gas they emmitt into our atmosphere. Also people take planes because they have a meeting but why don’t they just have a meeting through Skype. It would reduce people’s carbon footprint significantly. There is no point for people to be present for a meeting they can have online. I always wanted a job I can do from home not because I will reduce my carbon footprint but just because I wanted to stay home. Now I want a job from home so I can have a very small carbon footprint. I do not want to travel thousands of miles just to have a meeting.  I wish people who travel frequently realize this.

I agree that flying is the worst think that one can do environmentally, but I don't see any other plausible and convenient substitutions for flying. I like the idea of riding a bus or train, and thats typically what I do when I visit my sister in the Bay area, but for when it comes to visiting my parents in Mexico, taking a bus would not be safe at all and would take me days. I like spending time with them while I'm in school and when our breaks are only a week long, I can't afford to spend 4 days traveling. What surprised me was how much of a privilege flying is. I didn't  realize that I was one of the 100 people on earth. And in those few flights that I've taken, I've expended my annual CO2 limit about 4 times over, but because of the relatively insignificant amount of CO2 flying emits a year (2% of total greenhouse gas emissions), I'm not sure if we will ever see a solution.  I want to change, but for my safety and time, flying is simply the best option. 
<br><br>


A solution to this would be looking at one's carbon footprint holistically. If one were to drive each day a year they would have emitted 4.6 metric tons of CO2, if they then switched to public transportation and took only one flight a year, they would emit less than the 4.6 metric tons of CO2 they would have emitted simply from driving. The same logic can be applied to other areas in ones carbon footprint: the things they eat, the products they purchase and the homes they live in.

This is the exact type of comment I was looking for while scrolling. Just because flying is used by many people for businesses or travel vacations, they aren't the only uses. Many of us use air travel as our best option to visit and interact with family. For example, I have most of my family both in Mexico and in Colombia, yes its true we could drive to Mexico, but as you mentioned it is a very dangerous and risky task, and well I can't exactly switch out a flight to Colombia for a drive. Yes there are other methods to stay in contact with our international family, like facetime calls, but that doesn't satisfy the desire to physically be with them, especially for my parents who are visiting their moms whenever they can because we don't know how much time we have left with them. I, along with you, will honestly not abandon flying because it truly is the best option I have to interact with my family.


<br><hr>
I also really like your approach. My brother lives in the east coast and due to his short breaks flying is the only feasible way for him to see us, if he took took public transportation he would be out the door by the time he arrived. I also have family in Mexico, who I see once a year at most, who I would miss if I had to replace my trips with just phone calls. My grandparents are of the age where a once every five year flight like Ken suggested would be a risky idea. Even if I wanted to, I doubt I could ever convince my parents that they'd have to stop visiting their family. If I can make other changes to lessen my carbon footprint then I can offset my environmentally disastrous trips to visit my family. I hope that the innovation of the increasingly environmentally-conscious public will lead to more efficient planes, so that more than 1 in 100 people can enjoy aerial travel without dooming the earth.
<br><hr>
 I agree with your comment and also relate to it as well. I have family over in Mexico as well and have a desire to spend time with them, and even meet some I haven’t had the chance to yet. I travel at least once every two years and honestly I can’t see any other options around it. Also like you mentioned driving by car isn’t a reliable option because of safety concerns. I have family in Tijuana which I can easily visit whenever, but the majority is in Jalisco. Travelling there by car would be time consuming, as it would take a couple days. It is a risky trip in terms of safety; there’s dangerous places as well as roads which aren’t of the best quality. This would also be an issue as at work my parents can only get 1-2 weeks of vacation and this would take away time from our already limited time visiting. Flying may not be the best option in regards to how it affects the environment but it is the most reliable and efficient method. I mean who wouldn’t want to have a 3-4 hour trip compared to a 2-3 day one.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said about flying being the only option available for people to travel such great distances. I personally have never actually been on a plane, but I do understand that in many cases it can be the only mode of transportation that someone is able to take. Although flying only accounts for 2% of CO2 emissions, I do not believe that this is something that we should simply ignore or be passive about. Yes this is a small number compared to other things with higher rates, but it is also something that should be done in moderation. As for saying that those being able to fly in the first place is a privilege, I completely agree. Many people never leave their home countries, let alone their own state. Travel isn't something everyone can afford and have the privilege to do. For those that are able to, I believe that the world should be explored and is encouraged, but with some restraint. For the wealthy, there is no reason for you to have your own private jet or plane, you do not need to go fly to Europe every month, you do not need to go on 10+ vacations every single year. The climate crisis is growing at an extremely rapid rate and all of us must do our best to live the most sustainable life we can.
<br><hr>
I completely know how you feel! My family is out in Sinaloa so flying is definitely the most reliable option. Like you said, there's family we have yet to meet, and in addition there are memorable events in the future that I'm sure we wouldn't want to miss out on. Also, in regard to the time difference between driving and flying, not only do our parents want to take advantage of all of the days they have off of work to be in their hometowns, but sometimes there simply isn't enough time to spend on driving. For example, my cousin out there is getting married this year, if its during the school year I will literally have 2-3 days to fly out there for the event in order to not miss class, there is absolutely no way I am going to spend the whole time that I could spend with family out there in a car to get there, and I'm sure others can relate.

"Flying, the absolute worst thing that you can do environmentally" is a lecture talking about how bad it is to travel around with airplanes. It is very hard to image that about 3 tons of CO2 will be produced per trip we spend on the flight and it almost equal to the maximum amount one person should create in one and a half years, and if you are traveling in first class, the amount will even doubled. As the lecture mentioned, even though flight trip only contribute to 2 percent of the CO2 produced every year, the total amount is only produced by about 5 percent of all human beings on the planet. In other word, 19 in 20 people are totally innocent for it and only 1 of them are responsible. Putting on this scale, we as flight takers should reconsider other options we have to travel around.

Alternative options are actually not so bad, taking a slow trip definitely will be a great experience for a family to slow down and enjoy their lives from the daily business. Taking a train from Santa Barbara to San Francisco of course will allow us to appreciate more of the California landscape. And though it will take a long time, biking around will also be a good opportunity for us to take some exercise during vacations. It sounds to be very fun and most importantly, those are both environmentally friendly options.

As an international student and a person who loves to travel, the idea of slow travelling sounds very appealing to me. Back in my own country, I loved to travel by train and other types of mass transit. But when I arrived in the United States, the slow trains and bumpy bike roads really diminished my urge to travel the country via public transport. Like the professor said, I could slow travel and enjoy every stop along the way, but as a student who has academic work and many other chores, a three day weekend would not allow my friends and I to get to our desired destination. Yes, that is an excuse (many other professions have it much busier), but at the same time it is also because as a person who is used to fast travel, I am not able to get used to this new idea of slow travel. To resolve this issue, I believe that simply by experiencing it a few times would change my opinion.

Another point which seems like a dead end for us international students is the fact that we are international. At the start of every school year, we need to fly back via airplanes, and the same applies when going back home. I cannot really think of any other ways of flying across the Atlantic Ocean except for cruise ships and airplane, and both are equally damaging to the environment. Even if we try our best to decrease our carbon footprint, I guess there is not really a solution for us international students to stop using airplanes and other types of transportation in order to obtain our desired education.
